Since we've been a bit limited by Jakub's knee we've had to choose our trips more carefully as far as length and difficulty is concerned. That's why we made this walk which should have taken only about one hour. It should be noted right at the beginning that Jakub has chosen this track.

Before we set off the track we'd had to test our Australian boomerang. After a few attempts when the boomerang had almost ended in the stream nearby we decided to go to see the waterfalls.

For a while the path went easily through a grass area and we crossed a bridge over the Dry Creek two times. But after few more minutes we came to a place where a crossing was necessary but a bridge was missing.

This crossing was followed by second one, third one, fourth one ... I think we crossed the stream at least ten times. Easy peasy when your knees are fine but more complicated when one of them is a bit wobbly. But Jakub coped with it well, mainly thanks to walking poles, which helped us in crossing over slippery rocks.

After an hour we reached a small but nice waterfall and had a lunch on one of the bigger rock. There was water dropping all around us because of the recent rainy weather and the air in the surrounding bush smelled nicely fresh.

Refreshed by lunch we hopped up back to our car. On the way back we noticed a sign "WET FOOT" which we'd passed by without noticing before. Better to keep our eyes on signs next time :).

Anyway, even if we had a bit wet feet at the end of this walk is a nice one for an autumn afternoon.
