It’s been a while since we made our last “sleeping in a car” trip. There was always either something different on during weekends or the weather was bad. But recently, one Saturday morning, we finally managed to pack everything, including our new sleeping bags and set off to explore another little piece of New Zealand landscape.

Our final destination for that day was Waihi Falls. The 25 metres high waterfall is not really a popular touristic place, although it’s absolutely beautiful. Probably, it is the location in the middle of nowhere that discourages people from going there.

Once we passed the last bigger town, the way to the waterfalls was running through a farmland formed by little hillocks which were heavy with stock, mostly white sheep. Dwellings were rare, people even rarer and the whole picture of all those shades of green in the contrast with the bright blue sky was almost surreal.

From the carpark, it was only a few meters down to the waterfall and along the path there was a lookout which enables nice view of the whole area. The rest of the sunny afternoon we spent relaxing next to the stream.

As most places around New Zealand, Waihi Falls are also a great spot for taking pictures of the night sky. Surrounded only by meadows, we could enjoy billions of bright stars and clear Milky Way as much as we liked. Finally, we also succeeded in searching for Southern Cross.

After a while, it started to be a bit cold outside. That time, we really appreciated our new warm soft sleeping bags and felt asleep pretty quickly. Moreover, a classic New Zealand gale was shaking with the car instead of sweet lullaby.
