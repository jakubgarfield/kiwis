    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/13.jpg" alt="Milford and Doubtful Sound" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During our Christmas break, we spent two days in the area of &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/"&gt;Fiordland National Park&lt;/a&gt; where we planned to make two cruises - a shorter one in Milford Sound and a full day one in Doubtful&amp;nbsp;Sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Milford Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Milford Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our base in &lt;a href="http://www.yha.co.nz/hostels/south-island-hostels/yha-te-anau/"&gt;Te Anau&lt;/a&gt;, we headed off to Milford Sound along State Highway 94 which is regarded as one of the highest and most scenic highways in New Zealand. There is a number of short sidewalks which are definitely worth stopping such as The Mirror Lakes or The Chasm but just drive itself through the glacial Eglinton Valley is&amp;nbsp;spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view across Eglinton Valley" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view across Eglinton Valley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we reached the Homer Tunnel, the traffic started to be quite dense as the tunnel was only one way and operated by a traffic light. About 1200m long tunnel hewed from solid granite had nothing to do with those wide, smooth tunnels in the Alps in&amp;nbsp;Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waiting for our cruise at departure terminal" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Waiting for our cruise at departure terminal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Milford Sound shortly after midday and as the traffic around the tunnel indicated, the place was really busy and crowded. Boats of different operators were taking turns at the harbour and any minute we could hear a noise of small scenic planes in the air. I was at the place about 10 years ago and I don’t remember such a&amp;nbsp;buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heading off to the Tasman Sea" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Heading off to the Tasman Sea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While waiting for our cruise, we made an easy 20 minute loop through beech forest and along shore with some nice views of the fjord and surrounding peaks. But then we were ready to hop on &lt;a href="http://www.mitrepeak.com"&gt;our boat&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy the&amp;nbsp;cruise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The amazing weather highlighted the beauty of the sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The amazing weather highlighted the beauty of the sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip lasted about two hours and from harbour we cruised about 16 km to the open Tasman Sea. Straight at the beginning, we passed a massive Bowen Falls and the iconic Mitre Peak. We spotted a few fur seal colonies lying on the rocks. Once we reached St. Anne’s lighthouse and got to open sea, the waves were quite rough and our boat swung a lot. Luckily, our skipper didn’t let us suffer too long and after few minutes turned the boat back to the harbour. We concluded the cruise with the spray from Stirling Falls as the bout tried to approach it as close as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="We got a bit of spray from Stirling Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;We got a bit of spray from Stirling Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had not even absorbed the Milford Sound experience yet and we were already heading off to Lake Manapouri, where we started our &lt;a href="http://www.goorange.co.nz/doubtful-sound/the-cruise/"&gt;full day cruise to Doubtful Sound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="On the way to Doubtful Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;On the way to Doubtful Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started with an early and quiet cruise across Lake Manapouri to the West Arm Visitor Centre where we got some interesting information about the adjacent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manapouri_Power_Station"&gt;Underground Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. From there, we carried on by coach over Wilmot Pass into Doubtful Sound. In the morning, we were a bit in a rush but in the afternoon, on the way back, our driver made a few stops along this section, so we had enough time to wander around and enjoy all&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The silence and calm were amazing" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The silence and calm were amazing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the day started at Dove Cove where we got on board and cruised again about 30 km to the open Tasman Sea. We slowly sailed between tiny islands which reminded turtles lying on the water surface and big peaks which reminded an elephant’s&amp;nbsp;head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An elephant - do you see it too?" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An elephant - do you see it too?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got closer to the mouth of sound we chanced on fur seals. Later, on the way back, we met a few others that were excluded from their colonies to bulk themselves. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any luck to see penguins or&amp;nbsp;dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="It was a bit windy sometimes, but we had a lot of fun" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;It was a bit windy sometimes, but we had a lot of fun&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely a good decision to go with the first early cruise option because there were  no other boats and everything around looked quiet and calm, so we could fully enjoy that isolation. It was such a big contrast to busy Milford Sound and, eventually, it was also the reason why we preferred Doubtful Sound in the final&amp;nbsp;rating.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/24/queen-charlotte-track/">
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/9.jpg" alt="Queen Charlotte Track" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I’d heard about &lt;a href="http://www.qctrack.co.nz/on-the-track-/walk-the-track/"&gt;this track&lt;/a&gt; was when a friend of mine sent me an article from National Geographic about a selection of world’s best hikes. After a short discussion, we booked a ferry, bought &lt;a href="http://www.qctrack.co.nz/track-info/qctlc-pass/"&gt;passes for access&lt;/a&gt; to private land and then just hoped for a good&amp;nbsp;weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="On board on the way to Ship Cove" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;On board on the way to Ship Cove&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, we boarded a ferry and headed off to South Island. The sea was much calmer than the last time when we were on the way back to Wellington from our Christmas holiday and when a half of passengers on board was&amp;nbsp;sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the night in one of &lt;a href="http://www.yha.co.nz/hostels/south-island-hostels/yha-picton/"&gt;Picton’s backpackers&lt;/a&gt; and the next morning we and our big backpacks were ready to set off. The sun was shining and the cruise on the boat which took us to the beginning of the track was a great start of the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of farmland at Kenepuru Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of farmland at Kenepuru Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our hike at Ship Cove and planned to stay in campsites located on the ridge, so we took all our stuff with us. A tent, sleeping bags, food and camping gear for three days – our bags probably weighed about 12&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infinite blueness" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Infinite blueness&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were planning the track, I assumed that as it runs along the coast and the highest peak is about 400 m asl., the hike wouldn’t be difficult. The distances supposed to be long but elevation should be fine. I was wrong. The first day, we climbed about 1400 m in total as the path ran up and down all the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A path through enchanted forest" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A path through enchanted forest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to Furneaux Lodge, where we were going to catch a water taxi across Endeavour Inlet to Punga Cove, we walked through the cooling native forest and passed a few amazing lookouts with views of small&amp;nbsp;bays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The first lookout reached" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first lookout reached&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section between Punga Cove and a campsite at Bay of Many Coves was a bit struggle. I had sore feet because of too thick socks, was stung by a wasp and, in general, it was quite a long day. Therefore, we hesitated a little whether to do or not to do a side track to Eatwell’s Lookout. So lucky that we did it because the 360-degree view from the lookout was absolutely&amp;nbsp;stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A signpost at Eatwell’s lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A signpost at Eatwell’s lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, the track followed the ridge line with views over both Queen Charlotte Sound and Kenepuru Sound. At selected locations along the track, there are nice new benches made from massive wood where you can enjoy a view. During our breaks, most of the time, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka"&gt;fearless wekas&lt;/a&gt; kept us&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A weka looking for something to eat" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A weka looking for something to eat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was just shortly after midday when we reached Torea Saddle, we decided to carry on and spent the night at &lt;a href="http://www.mistletoebay.co.nz/"&gt;Mistletoe Bay campsite&lt;/a&gt; which would save us some time the next day when we would rush to catch a water taxi back to Picton. We regretted this decision a little bit as we scrambled up to the highest point on the track which, however, made it up to us with more great&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A short refreshment before descend to Torea Saddle" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A short refreshment before descend to Torea Saddle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we descended from the summit, we met a man who was working on track maintenance. It was an interesting character that was really keen on holding a philosophical conversation about where the world is aiming to. After a half an hour we left enriched with a few latin expressions (which were a bit wrong as Jakub realised&amp;nbsp;later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Kenepuru Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Towards Kenepuru Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final descent to the Mistletoe Bay Campsite was quite exhausting as we followed a steep shortcut which ran along not a well-maintained path and at one point we were afraid that we would have to turn back and climb it all the way back. Luckily, after a while, we reached the sealed road and, eventually, the campsite as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Another tiny bay" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Another tiny bay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were only 4 hours of walking left for the last day. After the initial climb from Mistletoe Bay, the track ran quite easily along the same contour line before it descended back to the coastline. In spite of that, it seemed to us like ages before we finally got to&amp;nbsp;Anakiwa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/8.jpg" alt="Hidden Secret of Ruakokoputuna River" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a big Christmas break which we spent around South Island, we kept with exploring places that are a bit closer to our base in&amp;nbsp;Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We planned to stay over the night at our favorite spot at Castlepoint and on the way there to make a walk to &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wairarapa/places/honeycomb-rock-area/things-to-do/honeycomb-rock-walkway/"&gt;Honeycomb Rock on the Wairarapa coast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A hiding cow on the way to Honeycomb Rock" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A hiding cow on the way to Honeycomb Rock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach the beginning of the walk we had to drive a decent distance along a gravel road which is always a bit painful for our old car. Basically, the whole track goes through a privately-owned land, so we were constantly surrounded by sheep or cows. Most of the time, there was no clear path and we just followed wooden poles stuck among&amp;nbsp;cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lazy seals relaxing on the beach" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lazy seals relaxing on the beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about two hours, we reached an outcrop risen above rocky coast. The walls really resembled cells which gave the rock it’s name. On adjacent rocks, there was a small number of relaxing fur seals. They didn’t care about anything and just sniffled bit louder when Jakub got too&amp;nbsp;close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Honeycomb Rock named because of the cell-like pattern " src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Honeycomb Rock named because of the cell-like pattern &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive across to Castlepoint took a couple of hours and when we got there it’d already got dark. Our plans to stay over the night at the carpark were thwarted by a sign which allowed staying only to self-contained cars. It was a bit surprising as the sign hadn’t been there last time when we’d made &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/02/28/castlepoint-surf-trip/"&gt;our surf trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The beautiful Wairarapa coastline &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we found another spot and the next day in the morning we woke up to a wonderful sunny day and had a great view of see right from the boot of our&amp;nbsp;car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such a gorgeous weather, we decided to visit &lt;a href="http://www.patunafarm.co.nz/patuna-chasm/"&gt;Patuna Farm&lt;/a&gt; and do a Patuna Chasm walk which my workmate had recommended. So, after morning surf session for Jakub and coffee for me, we headed off to&amp;nbsp;Ruakokoputuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Part of the track ran across farmland" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Part of the track ran across farmland&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the farm we were given a safety induction and a paper with a detailed description of the walk. The beginning of the walk was marked with a weed spray arrow on one of the tree trunks along the road. It wasn’t clearly visible, so first, we passed it by, of&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="At the beginning the cold water wasn’t bad during such a hot day" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;At the beginning the cold water wasn’t bad during such a hot day&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the walk ran across farmland and through bush. We crossed the river once and enjoyed some nice views of surrounded hills. However, the real fun began when we climbed a ladder and entered to the chasm. From that point, the walk carried on through the&amp;nbsp;river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A waterfall at the upper end of chasm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few meters upstream was a nice waterfall, but then we followed the way of flow and walked downstream through the narrow limestone gorge. Most of the time, the water level reached only up to our knees. But, there were some parts which got a bit deeper and we ended with a backpack above our&amp;nbsp;heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The rock tunnels" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The rock tunnels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking for the best way to get over one deeper spot, we ran across a number of fossils as we climbed over a big&amp;nbsp;rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we proceeded to the end of the chasm, we walked through a few massive tunnels where stalactites hung from the ceiling and along the&amp;nbsp;walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="At some parts it got quite dark and cold as well" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;At some parts it got quite dark and cold as well&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we went through the end of the chasm, the sun and warm air were really nice as, despite the middle of summer, the water was quite cold. However, all that fun was definitely worth our frozen toes and we got warm on the way up back to our car&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tongariro Alpine Crossing is one of New Zealand’s most popular walks as it is easily accessible, it takes only about 5 to 7 hours and during nice weather conditions you can enjoy amazing views of volcanoes and small colourful&amp;nbsp;lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A colourful volcanic landscape" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A colourful volcanic landscape&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we did the crossing last year, the weather wasn’t ideal because, while we were driving to the beginning of the track, it looked like there are no volcanoes at all. Luckily, when we reached the Red Crated and slowly descended to Emerald Lakes, the sun brought through the clouds and from the further side of Central Crater we could see the Red Crater, previously covered by&amp;nbsp;clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Blue Lake in the background" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Blue Lake in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, Jakub was luckier about the weather and all highlights showed up in the summer&amp;nbsp;sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One disadvantage of the track is its popularity itself. During the high season, there are heaps of tourists who climb up to the Red Crater as a long slow snake. Now and then, we were surprised what kind of clothes were people able to wear for such kind of track, when they were supposed to walk in&amp;nbsp;debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inside the Red Crater" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Inside the Red Crater&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, as we organised an early shuttle, we avoided the crowd and walked through the Mangatepopo Valley up to the Soda Springs only with few other people. From that point, the people started to accumulate as the terrain got steeper and up to the Red Crater they already moved on as a giant&amp;nbsp;snake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Soda Springs on the way to the Red Crater" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Soda Springs on the way to the Red Crater&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest point of crossing, the Red Crater, we had to pass without any good view as it was covered by clouds. We couldn’t see it, but we definitely could smell&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, while we were sliding on debris down from Red Crater, the sun came out and the brilliant Emerald Lakes showed up. The giant snake stopped and the mass photography&amp;nbsp;began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Emerald Lakes" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Emerald Lakes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crowd spread again as we walked across the Central Crater and once we passed the Blue Lake, the Red Crater appeared at the back so, at least, we could see it from the bottom when not from the&amp;nbsp;top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Red Crater out of clouds" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Red Crater out of clouds&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the track was a bit boring. Particularly because of dense clouds which covered everything all around and disabled any good views, but this part of the track was also long and same all the time. We did a quick stop at Ketetahi Hut, but then carried on with a fast pace to finish the&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The clouds covered everything around" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The clouds covered everything around&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, almost at the same time as we finished the track, the sky cleared up. Now? At least, while the shuttle was driving us back to our accommodation, we had a great view of all the volcanoes. Moreover, as a bonus, we could see a small volcanic activity at a side vent of the volcano. A little compensation for bad&amp;nbsp;weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The walk across the Central Plateau&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; The photos with the sunny weather were taken by Jakub this year when he did the&amp;nbsp;crossing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/11.jpg" alt="Tree Trunk Gorge and a Naughty Possum" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a big plan for our last free weekend before Christmas. After a few evenings, spent by looking for a right track, we finally decided to drive up north to Lake Taupo and do a multi-day track in the Kaimanawa&amp;nbsp;Forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of a few crossings during Tree Trunk Track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of a few crossings during Tree Trunk Track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sunny afternoon, our journey easily went by and we also managed to avoid to the usual Friday’s traffic jam when everybody tries to escape from Wellington. After a short dinner break, which we ate with a company of calm sheep, we arrived at our camping spot when it was already&amp;nbsp;dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The forest in sunshine" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The forest in sunshine&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning brought a disappointment. The hills were covered in dense clouds and showered by the persistent rain, there was no point to climb up to the hills with no chance of any good views. Time to change our&amp;nbsp;plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A camping spot" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A camping spot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first replacement - Pillars of Hercules track - was not a big success. After a few meters, the path of the track got overgrown and as we were struggling through vegetation we got totally wet. Eventually, we lost the path completely. The highlight of this track was a view from swing&amp;nbsp;bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A swing bridge along Pillars of Hercules track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the Tree Trunk Gorge track was a much better choice. It was a nice easy walk through the native bush with a few crossings over the streams and it ended with an amazing view of pure water rushing through a narrow&amp;nbsp;gorge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The view of Tree Trunk Gorge" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The view of Tree Trunk Gorge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking for a place where we’d stay over the night, we found a little lake Rotopounamu At the beginning of the loop around the lake, we met a Polish guy, who had been travelling in New Zealand for a couple of months and we made the loop&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The look around lake Rotopounamu" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The look around lake Rotopounamu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place for overnight stay we found near the Okupata Cave - in the middle of nowhere. The road there was in terrible conditions. The rain had created deep gullies across the unsealed road and our poor old car could hardly cope with it. No signal and more constant rain made up ideal conditions for Jakub’s tragical scenarios of being stuck there and never get back&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Lake Taupo" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Lake Taupo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation escalated when suddenly, in the middle of the night, a funny noise started to coming out from the car engine. A naughty possum biting our car cables! The possum would have really laughed seeing Jakub with a torch, running around the car in the middle of the night, during heavy rain and trying to frighten it off by knocking and banging on the bonnet of our&amp;nbsp;car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Tree Trunk Gorge again" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Tree Trunk Gorge again&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the possum probably found something better to eat then our cables because the next day morning we easily started up and drove away right after we’d had a quick look at near cave&amp;nbsp;entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Next to the entrance to Okupata Cave" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Next to the entrance to Okupata Cave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, all that panic was for nothing. However, the next time we’ll try to find a place closer to civilisation. Or at least, closer to cell phone signal. Just in&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rainy weekends are a bit boring here in Wellington and it’s usually challenging to make up a plan which would provide a feeling of satisfaction when you summarize your time on the Sunday&amp;nbsp;evenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/national-geographic-exhibition/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Excited Bara looking at photo" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/national-geographic-exhibition/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Excited Bara looking at photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During days like that, when the weather forecast shows continuous rain for a whole day, I’m usually desperately looking for any interesting museum, exhibition or other indoor activity. In the meanwhile, Jakub is desperately looking for some time under the&amp;nbsp;blanket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/national-geographic-exhibition/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Visitors at the gallery" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/national-geographic-exhibition/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Visitors at the gallery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a rainy Saturday, we decided to visit Palmerston North which hosted a National Geographic Exhibition at that time. The exhibition presented a collection of the best  pictures which had been taken and issued in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; magazines and even when we’d already seen most of them before, it was great to see the photos at one place all&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/national-geographic-exhibition/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The venue of NG Exhibition - The Museum of Art, Science and History in Palmerston North" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/national-geographic-exhibition/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The venue of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; Exhibition - The Museum of Art, Science and History in Palmerston North&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, besides the exhibition, there wasn’t really much to visit in Palmerston. So, no matter how impressive the photos were, we had to admit that our decision was a bit poor as we spent about an hour in gallery compared to four long hours on the&amp;nbsp;road.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/12/14/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/">
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/1.jpg" alt="Old Mill Track at Aorangi Range" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Mill Track was kind of an emergency decision. Traditionally, after checking the weather forecast, we had to abandon our initial plan in the Tararua Range. Neither an alternate plan in the Orongorongo Valley worked as all possible huts were fully booked. Tired of endless searching, we finally decided for a track in the Aorangi&amp;nbsp;Range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The view of Aorangi Forest Park" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The view of Aorangi Forest Park&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way there, we stopped for lunch at a nice cafe in Martinborough where we spent a little fortune for burgers with red wine jelly. We deserved something fancy before we’d get back to our canned tuna and noodles. Full of energy, we arrived at the carpark at the beginning of the track in the early&amp;nbsp;afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The intersection with the Pig Ridge Track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The intersection with the Pig Ridge Track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the track was easy and we shortly reached an intersection with the Pig Ridge Track. At that point, the path started to be a bit rough after a while as there were some landslides and uprooted trees. Moreover, we often had to struggle through the bush and I didn’t feel really comfortable with the view of deep gully below&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara during one of crossings" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/old-mill-track-at-aorangi-range/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara during one of crossings&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was happy that we finally reached the Turanganui River and I didn’t even mind that we had to take our shoes off and do a few crossings through the cold water. Suddenly, while we were in the middle of one crossing, a group of dogs shot out from the bush. That time, we met out overnighters - two hunters and their four dogs. They were nice guys, apart from the fact that about 10 pm they started to prepare their pork sausages which smelled really nice and embarrassed our poor tuna noodles. Actually, a part of that smell we took away soaked in our sleeping&amp;nbsp;bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;We spent a night at the Sutherlands Hut with two hunters and their four doggies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, we woke up really early. Partially because of the hunters who were leaving the hut early and partially because we could sleep in our way too warm sleeping bags no&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A little rest on green clearing with nice views of Aorangi Range&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While finishing the loop, we made one unsuccessful attempt to climb to Mt Ross but after a while, we totally lost the path in the dense bush and had to give up. However, we didn’t have to regret too much as clouds covered the top of the hill in the next couple of hours and before that happened we could, at least, enjoyed some nice views from little green clearings along the path. But next time, we leave Aorangi Range to&amp;nbsp;hunters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/waihi-falls/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/waihi-falls/5.jpg" alt="Waihi Falls" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since we made our last “sleeping in a car” trip. There was always either something different on during weekends or the weather was bad. But recently, one Saturday morning, we finally managed to pack everything, including our new sleeping bags and set off to explore another little piece of New Zealand&amp;nbsp;landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/waihi-falls/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="On the way to Waihi Waterfalls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/waihi-falls/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;On the way to Waihi Waterfalls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final destination for that day was Waihi Falls. The 25 metres high waterfall is not really a popular touristic place, although it’s absolutely beautiful. Probably, it is the location in the middle of nowhere that discourages people from going&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we passed the last bigger town, the way to the waterfalls was running through a farmland formed by little hillocks which were heavy with stock, mostly white sheep. Dwellings were rare, people even rarer and the whole picture of all those shades of green in the contrast with the bright blue sky was almost&amp;nbsp;surreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/waihi-falls/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Our four wheel hotel" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/waihi-falls/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our four wheel hotel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the carpark, it was only a few meters down to the waterfall and along the path there was a lookout which enables nice view of the whole area. The rest of the sunny afternoon we spent relaxing next to the&amp;nbsp;stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A Waihi Waterfall in morning sunshine&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most places around New Zealand, Waihi Falls are also a great spot for taking pictures of the night sky. Surrounded only by meadows, we could enjoy billions of bright stars and clear Milky Way as much as we liked. Finally, we also succeeded in searching for Southern&amp;nbsp;Cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A night sky above Waihi Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, it started to be a bit cold outside. That time, we really appreciated our new warm soft sleeping bags and felt asleep pretty quickly. Moreover, a classic New Zealand gale was shaking with the car instead of sweet&amp;nbsp;lullaby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/6.jpg" alt="Bali&amp;#58; from rice terraces to  temple and waterfall" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As there were so many things to see, but so little time, a schedule for the second one-day trip was quite tight. Distances between places weren’t large, but we didn’t know that an average speed in Bali is about 40 km/h. Moreover, a whole situation was complicated by the fact, that our local driver got lost a few times. But at least, he could ask locals for&amp;nbsp;directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hindu architecture at Luhur Batukaru Temple" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached our first destination, rice terraces in Jatiluwih, without any difficulties as it is a popular tourist destination and there were heaps of people around. The terraces were located at the foot of a mountain and spread to the coastline which enabled great views. Just an entrance fee which Balinese tried to get from photo-eager tourists was a bit&amp;nbsp;exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of rice terraces in Jatiluwih" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of rice terraces in Jatiluwih&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the way to our next stop, Luhur Batukaru Temple, was a tough proposition for our driver. However, as a reward, we had a chance to visited a solitary temple surrounded by tropical forest. The temple complex also included a vast garden, but as the rain season was not yet to come, everything looked a bit dry. The one thing we were surprised about was that even a sacred site like this was quite dirty with the garbage thrown all&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;In Luhur Batukaru Temple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to Botanic Garden, our driver was trying to find a shortcut. Eventually, we were driving along a road which looked more like a tank training area than anything else. And yes, I forgot to mention, that we probably had to pay off a little kid to tell us the right way to get&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A lady bargaining with us about price of fruit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A lady bargaining with us about price of fruit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garden itself was huge with a plenty of open areas where Balinese families were enjoying their free afternoon while having picnics and playing sports games. We visited a big glasshouse with a cactus collection and walked through Begonia garden. However, the most beautiful was an orchids section with its gazebo covered by an ocean of greenery. In the garden, they’ve been specialising in collecting wild Indonesian orchids species, mainly from mountain&amp;nbsp;forests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An orchids selection in Bali Botanic Garden" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a mission of the day was searching for a waterfall located around a little village of Munduk. Even when our driver figured out, that using his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; might be quite useful (after a few unsuccessful attempts of finding right location), it took us ages to get there. Even with advice from locals. Or maybe just because of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A sunset on the way back to Canggu" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A sunset on the way back to Canggu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the waterfall was none too astonishing, but we had to appreciate our driver’s effort, anyway. We took that guy back to our accommodation about 10pm and he probably did his best to fit our&amp;nbsp;schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days ago, we came back from our first trip to Indonesia. It took a while to catch up with everything, but now it’s finally time to sort out all&amp;nbsp;memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Offerings to Gods include anything" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Offerings to Gods include anything&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we started surfing a couple years ago, Bali has been one of Jakub’s dream surfing destinations. But, even though this trip was mainly planned as a surf camp, we also made a few one-day trips around the&amp;nbsp;island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rice terraces near Gunung Kawi" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rice terraces near Gunung Kawi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traffic in Bali was absolute madness with no rules. Cars and scooters overtook from both right and left side no matter what, a number of lanes depended on width of the road (a pavement was often included into the calculation as well) and sometimes not even a direction was a big deal as some scooters went suddenly opposite to the traffic flow. Actually, there probably was one rule - use your horn. All the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Decoration in Tirta Empul" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Decoration in Tirta Empul&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, during the drive from the airport we decided to hire a driver for our one-day trips. It was reasonably cheap and definitely&amp;nbsp;safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A beans’ journey from civet’s poo to coffee powder" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A beans’ journey from civet’s poo to coffee powder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our driver Zainal was recommended to us by our “surf beach boss”. The first nice thing about him was that he could speak English quite well. It made our whole day trip much easier and interesting as we learnt about some local stuff as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A coffee tasting time" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A coffee tasting time&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop we made at Silver and Gold Workshop. About seventy people were working in a small dingy hall and creating jewellery of all kind of shapes and sizes. A contrast between the workshop and a gift shop which we visited afterwards was enormous as a marble hall full of jewellery was shining bright and you could spend a fortune&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Workers creating a piece of silver art" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Workers creating a piece of silver art&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quick stop we made at a batik workshop. It wasn’t really anything special and could have been skipped as there was only one woman working and a few other people painting on a fancy cloths. Moreover, we didn’t want to buy anything as Jakub had already bought his “ceremonial”&amp;nbsp;sarong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An equipment for batik painting" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An equipment for batik painting&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, it was a time for a coffee tasting. During a short walk in show garden, we saw different types of coffee trees and also little civet cats. Luwak coffee alias civet coffee is a big thing in Bali. You can find it on a menu of many cafes, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is the real one. It was interesting to see coffee beans’ journey from a civet poo to coffee powder. However, Luwak coffee itself compared to a standard cup of coffee wasn’t much different to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A civet in charge of producing Luwak coffee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to Tirta Empul, we made a stop at Tegalalang. There were beautiful views of rice terraces and we could freely stroll along the paths meandering in the&amp;nbsp;fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of rice terraces in Tegalalang" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of rice terraces in Tegalalang&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tirta Empul is famous for its sacred spring and a lot of people were having a bath in pools as it’s believed that it would bring fortune and health. We missed this opportunity and just walked around the temple and admired its architecture. To get out of the temple, we had to walk through a local market where women were trying to sell us anything possible at each&amp;nbsp;step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="People having bath in sacred water" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;People having bath in sacred water&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally got to our car we drove to Gunung Kawi which was probably our most favorite place of the day. It’s located in a ravine between rice fields and a lack of tourists made this place quieter and more peaceful than the temple before. A turn-off before getting down to the main temple was really worth it as we walked through rice fields to the hidden parts of the&amp;nbsp;complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gunung Kawi alias Valley of Kings" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/bali-luwak-sacred-spring-rice-terraces/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Gunung Kawi alias Valley of Kings&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A that was our last stop for that&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
