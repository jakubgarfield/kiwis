Before snowboarding in South Island there was almost a two year gap since our last snowboarding in Europe. That must have been the reason why we were so quickly tired even after a half day on the slope.

But as we only went down there for short amount of time we didn’t want to waste it with too much relaxing and so we mingled snowboarding with small walks in near surroundings of  Springfield.

One afternoon we went to explore Castle Hill Rocks --- a limestone formation raising from a green meadow about 30 minutes from Springfield.

There is a short loop which runs between the rocks with some nice views of mountains all around.

As Castle Hill is a popular place for climbing and bouldering we saw a few people hanging on the rock sides with soft safety mats lying on the ground below them. Really small safety mats I would say.

We showed our piece of “acrobatics” when we tried to scrambled up one little boulder. Jakub laughed at me firstly, but his attempt wasn’t much more impressive either.

On the way back we were looking at different shapes of boulders and tried to guess what they resemble. There was a nose, a big head or a big ass…but different people see things in different ways.
