    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/5.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Lake St Clair and tiger snake" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coming back from Christmas holiday, we were looking for a destination which we would explore during Easter. We had a really great time in &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/04/26/blue-mountains/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; last year and eventually we decided to go back to the region. But this time, we planned to visit the Apple Island –&amp;nbsp;Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Some parts of the track were easy, the others were not" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Some parts of the track were easy, the others were not&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite our colleagues comments “What are you going to do there? There is nothing.” we were convinced that it’s an exciting place with the nice nature and wildlife. Moreover, we still had vouchers from Jetstar as a compensation for delayed flight from &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/11/22/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; last October. With a bit of “luck”, we might get some more this time&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of many little clearings on the way back to Cynthia Bay" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of many little clearings on the way back to Cynthia Bay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After arrival to Hobart, we picked up our little &lt;a href="https://www.thrifty.com.au/"&gt;rental Kia&lt;/a&gt; and drove to a &lt;a href="http://www.barilla.com.au/"&gt;booked campsite&lt;/a&gt; located conveniently near the airport. As we recently bought a new tent, this was our first big camping trip because, before, we only tested it during our weekend trips like the &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/24/queen-charlotte-track/"&gt;Queen Charlotte track&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="If you fancy a burger, The Standard is a good choice" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;If you fancy a burger, The Standard is a good choice&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we built the tent on our artificial grass spot, we went for a stroll around the evening city. While looking for a place to have dinner, we came across a hidden burger stand – &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/standardburgers"&gt;The Standard&lt;/a&gt;. A simple stage was provided for seating and we ate our yummy burger under a ceiling covered by lampions. The evening was wrapped up with a chilled drink at another random tiny&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An interesting ceiling at The Standard" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An interesting ceiling at The Standard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to our campsite, we met the wildlife for the first time - two wallabies sitting in the middle of the road. Luckily, we drove slowly enough and they managed to skip safely&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning, we left cloudy Hobart behind and headed off to Lake St Clair. On the way, we enjoyed the surrounded landscape covered by the sunshine. We could smell the autumn in the air. As we were a bit in a rush to catch a ferry across the lake, we didn’t really had a chance to make any big stops, except the one for coffee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; cheesecake in &lt;a href="http://www.hamiltonheritageholidayhomes.com.au/"&gt;Jackson’s Emporium&lt;/a&gt; in Hamilton. The place looked a bit shabby from outside, but an interior was really&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A coffee break at Jackson’s Emporium" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A coffee break at Jackson’s Emporium&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Lake St Clair just on time to buy a &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=914"&gt;National Park pass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lakestclairlodge.com.au/about-lake-st-clair/lake-st-clair-ferry/"&gt;ferry tickets&lt;/a&gt; and then we rushed to the jetty where a boat was already&amp;nbsp;waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Mt Olympus " src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Mt Olympus &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a 15 minutes sail, we had a great view of surrounding peaks before we got off at Narcissus Bay and set off for about a 17 km long way back to Cynthia&amp;nbsp;Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Wellington, before our holiday, Jakub had done a research in Tasmanian dangerous animals and what kind of equipment might be needed. Gaiters had been one of the optional recommendations as a protection against snake bite, but eventually, we hadn’t bought any. And so it happened that within first fifteen minutes, as we walked through sunny open woodlands, we met a &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=4750"&gt;tiger snake&lt;/a&gt;. It was lying in the sunshine right next to the path. Luckily, it slithered away and left us only in a little shock. After that experience, we spent most of the time staring at the ground to avoid any other&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A sunset at Lake St Clair" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A sunset at Lake St Clair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, when we walked into the rainforest, the path winded among trees and sometimes it was even hard to follow it in a maze of roots. At Echo Point, we made a short break but then carried on because there were still 10 km&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A quick break at Echo Point jetty" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A quick break at Echo Point jetty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were approaching to Cynthia Bay, the sun getting closer to the horizon and the dense rainforest was getting darker. We could smell tea tree in the air. Suddenly, we heard a noise in the bush. After a while of staring at shrubs, we saw there a little wallaby hiding and eating some grass but as soon as it mentioned us, it quickly jumped&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Our shiny, kind of new, portable hotel" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our shiny, kind of new, portable hotel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the track within about 5 hours and reached the &lt;a href="https://www.lakestclairpark.com.au/"&gt;campsite&lt;/a&gt; right on time to manage to build our tent with the rest of daylight. After tasty dinner and with kilometers in our legs, we were already in our cosy sleeping bags when we heard our neighbours grumbling about the mess a possum made around their camping spot while they were doing the&amp;nbsp;dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cold misty morning at Lake St Clair" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cold misty morning at Lake St Clair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, we quickly felt asleep because there were other exciting journeys waiting for the next&amp;nbsp;day!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Day hike to Mt McKerrow summit</title>
    <published>2016-04-05T09:13:35Z</published>
    <updated>2016-04-05T09:13:35Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/04/05/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/">
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/8.jpg" alt="Day hike to Mt McKerrow summit" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since we did &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/rimutaka-forest-park/things-to-do/tracks/mt-mckerrow/"&gt;Mt McKerrow track&lt;/a&gt;, but now it would be shame to keep this track just to ourselves as it is conveniently close to Wellington and it’s perfect for a shorter day&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The path to the Mt McKerrow summit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The path to the Mt McKerrow summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climb to Mt Mckerrow starts from Catchpool Valley or Wainuiomata. As we’d already done that part of the track from Catchpool Valley side before, we decided to leave our car in Wainuiomata and start the track from&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="We started somewhere down there" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;We started somewhere down there&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather wasn’t really impressive that day with a typical &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/15/where-world-windiest-city-spoiler-alert-chicago-wellington"&gt;Wellingtonian gale&lt;/a&gt;, so we appreciated the track path ran through the forest which protected us from being blown away. On the other hand, it prevented from any good&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lost in the deep forest" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lost in the deep forest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the track was quite steep, but once we reached the top of the hill and walked along the ridge, the only difficulty was roots and a bit of mud. Moreover, if there was no sign – an iron pole – we would miss the Mt McKerrow summit at&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rimutaka Range in the background" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rimutaka Range in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, where trees became sparse, there were some good views of &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2014/08/31/east-harbour-regional-park/"&gt;Wellington Harbour and East Regional Park&lt;/a&gt; on one side and Rimutaka Range on the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fifty shades of green" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fifty shades of green&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we decided to turn down to the Boys Brigade camp to avoid returning along the same path to the car-park. However, the track was a bit rough and not really comfortable, especially when it connected to a slippery &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4WD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One more view towards Wainuiomata and Hutt Valley" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One more view towards Wainuiomata and Hutt Valley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the track within about 5 hours, including a short wrong turn-off, which made it a nice Saturday afternoon walk. Just next time, we definitely need more water as during that initial climb you get quite&amp;nbsp;sweaty.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Hiking food for a 3 day track</title>
    <published>2016-03-29T19:16:20Z</published>

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/03/30/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/">
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/1.jpg" alt="Hiking food for a 3 day track" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food plays an important part on your hike. It keeps your energy levels up throughout the day and enables you to regenerate over the night. On a three day hike, you don’t have to make a big science out of it as you can pig out later when you get back home, but it’s still nice to have a good meal in the evening and be ready for the next&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your food to be light, packable, nutritious and reasonably tasty. Tin of tuna in an olive oil is nutritious, tastes delicious, but also quite&amp;nbsp;heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Food needs to be as light and as packable as possible" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Food needs to be as light and as packable as possible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we like the food to be as simple as possible and most of the instant hiking foods contains all those preservatives and artificial stuff so we decided to create our own &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; food from basic ingredients. It’s not as hard as you might think and it’s surprisingly&amp;nbsp;cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="quick-list"&gt;Quick&amp;nbsp;list&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;One
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;breakfast: big breakfast in a&amp;nbsp;hostel&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack: peanut butter muesli&amp;nbsp;bar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;lunch: crackers with&amp;nbsp;cheese&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack:&amp;nbsp;nuts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dinner: couscous with minced beef and&amp;nbsp;vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;Two
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;breakfast: scrambled eggs with leftover&amp;nbsp;couscous&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack:&amp;nbsp;dates&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;lunch: crackers with&amp;nbsp;cheese&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack:&amp;nbsp;nuts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dinner: minced beef with mashed potatoes and&amp;nbsp;vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;three
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;breakfast: scrambled eggs with leftover mashed&amp;nbsp;potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack: peanut butter muesli&amp;nbsp;bar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;lunch: crackers with&amp;nbsp;cheese&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack:&amp;nbsp;nuts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dinner: big dinner in a&amp;nbsp;restaurant&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table is the approximate amount of food for two people for a three day hike that kept us full and&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class="table"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style="text-align: left"&gt;Meal&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style="text-align: center"&gt;Total weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style="text-align: right"&gt;Portion weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style="text-align: right"&gt;Price (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NZD&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Scrambled eggs&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;160 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;40 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Crackers&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;450 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;75g&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id="breakfast"&gt;Breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Having breakfast in nature is an amazing feeling" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Having breakfast in nature is an amazing feeling&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, we normally have eggs in any form, but it’s not very practical to take them on the trail so we tried variations of porridge and oats — without much success as we felt hungry soon. Breakfast was an issue for us until we discovered these &lt;a href="http://backcountrycuisine.co.nz/bcc/index.php/archives/223"&gt;freeze dried scrambled eggs&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, they are made out of normal ingredients and they taste nice. We like to mix them with a bit of leftovers from dinners — usually plain couscous or mashed&amp;nbsp;potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="lunch"&gt;Lunch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love &lt;a href="http://shop.countdown.co.nz/Shop/ProductDetails?stockcode=289839"&gt;walnut oat crackers by 180 degrees&lt;/a&gt; with an aged cheddar – amazing taste and lasts forever. It’s a nice easy meal that can be spread over multiple stops and you don’t have to set up your gas&amp;nbsp;burner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Munging through those cheese and crackers" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Munging through those cheese and crackers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we carry an extra stick of Hungarian-style salami, but mostly we are fine with the vegetarian&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="snacks"&gt;Snacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We carry three different types of snack but really it’s up to you and what you like. First, we have a mix of natural nuts – usually cashews, almonds, Brazil nuts, Macadamian and&amp;nbsp;walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of commercially produced muesli bars that are full of sugar and god knows what, we &lt;a href="http://www.wildbackpacker.com/backpacking-food/recipes/backpacking-lunch-snack-recipes/"&gt;make our own&lt;/a&gt;. And it is surprisingly tasty and easy to make – you don’t even have to bake. Mix three cups of quick oats with a cup of heated peanut butter and add up to a cup of honey. Stir everything together (you can add cranberries, raisins, chopped almonds or anything you like), press it into a box container and put into the&amp;nbsp;fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="After a big hike you need to keep your energy levels high" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;After a big hike you need to keep your energy levels high&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third to the party is a pack of dried dates. Dates are delicious, more nutritious than candy and helps with your sweet&amp;nbsp;tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a small piece of dark chocolate is always a welcoming surprise after a tough&amp;nbsp;climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dinner"&gt;Dinner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner is usually your biggest meal of the day on a hike as you have time to prepare it and you don’t have to move afterwards. For a track this long, you don’t have to be too creative and meals can be quite simple. I’m a fan of freeze dried ingredients as their are light, but not a fan of instant meals as they usually contains lots of things that are bad for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fine dining in a hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fine dining in a hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorites are &lt;a href="http://backcountrycuisine.co.nz/bcc/index.php/archives/226"&gt;freeze dried minced beef&lt;/a&gt; as a good source of protein and &lt;a href="http://backcountrycuisine.co.nz/bcc/index.php/archives/242"&gt;vegetable mix&lt;/a&gt; (carrots, peas, corn). We usually get a pack of 160 g of beef which lasts us for the whole trip and the same applies to&amp;nbsp;vegetable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two things create a base that can be combined with couscous for one day and instant mashed potato flakes for the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: Use dehydrated milk for your mashed potatoes to make it taste like&amp;nbsp;heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sandwich plastic bags are handy to store portions and save on weight" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sandwich plastic bags are handy to store portions and save on weight&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, carry a small plastic bottle of olive oil and add couple spoons to each meal to boost the calories and fat content. Remember, fat keeps you warm at&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing I love is a pot of chicken stock after the main course. I’d like to think that it adds all those important ions and salts that I lost during the hike. Maybe, maybe not – at least it keeps me&amp;nbsp;hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Your meal will always taste delicious on the trail" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Your meal will always taste delicious on the trail&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food for two people for three day hike comes to 60 New Zealand dollars, tastes pretty good and is much healthier than the instant hiker meals that you can buy in the outdoor shops. Give it a try and let us know how you enjoyed it. Also, what do you usually eat on the&amp;nbsp;track?&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2016-03-15T06:58:37Z</published>
    <updated>2016-03-15T06:58:37Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/03/15/a-day-with-hobbits/">
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/71.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/71.jpg" alt="A day with Hobbits" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Christmas, during our travel around North Island, we made a stop near small town of Matamata. There is not much around, mostly farmlands, and it probably used to be one of those little quiet towns until it became the middle of Middle-Earth. The Shire with its setting known as the &lt;a href="http://www.hobbitontours.com/"&gt;Hobbiton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/81.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of surrounding farmland" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/81.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of surrounding farmland&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we visited an incredibly touristy place where you pay heaps of money for permission to walk and stare around. But we thought, when we are here, in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NZ&lt;/span&gt;, we should give it a&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/79.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="On bus with other with other tourists eager for hobbits" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/79.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;On bus with other with other tourists eager for hobbits&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we bought the tickets, our tour began with about 20 minutes drive on board of bus that took us through farmland to the Shire. In the meanwhile, our guide gave as short introduction about filming beginnings and about dealing with &lt;a href="http://media.newzealand.com/en/story-ideas/hobbiton-from-family-farm-to-film-fame/"&gt;farmland owner family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/58.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A little veggie garden - all eatable" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/58.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A little veggie garden - all eatable&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a car park we set off along the path to Hobbiton accompanied by our guide. Shortly, we stopped at little veggie garden where different kind of vegetable and herbs were grown. Further, as we slowly walked to up to the hill, we were passing Hobbit holes with their colourful round doorways and perfect tiny gardens. One would expect that when you open the door there would be a hobbit inside eating one of their six meals per day. Nope. Unfortunately, it was nothing inside except a few planks and&amp;nbsp;dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/69.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Beg End - the Bilbo’s place" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/69.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Beg End - the Bilbo’s place&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, we reached a hole with a deep green coloured door - the Beg End. The Bilbo’s home located under shade of great oak tree. The story of this tree was quite interesting as it was brought into Hobbiton in chopped pieces and bolted together again. Our guide told us, that when they wired all artificial leaves, the director didn’t like the shade of green colour. So, all of them had to be removed and recoloured.&amp;nbsp;Crazy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/72.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="No post today" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/72.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;No post today&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we walked down towards the lake, the smoke raised from tiny chimneys and spread above the hill. We passed a watermill with a small jetty where a hobbit’s boat was parked, crossed over the bridge and reached the Green Dragon&amp;nbsp;Inn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/73.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A watermill and a tiny hobbit’s boat" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/73.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A watermill and a tiny hobbit’s boat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked the interior of that place as the most of it was built from timber and stone. It warm and cosy with the running fireplace and leather arm chairs. As we went on the late afternoon tour, the place wasn’t too much busy which was good. Otherwise, you have to try to ignore the crowds to enjoy the atmosphere and a &lt;a href="http://www.hobbitontours.com/TheGreenDragon"&gt;pint of craft beer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/76.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A chill out in front of fireplace with a pint of beer" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/76.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A chill out in front of fireplace with a pint of beer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in my opinion, it wasn’t a bad experience. In Jakub’s opinion, it was a waste of money. I’m glad that we went there, but the true is that, unless you are really a fan of everything around The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies, it’s probably not worth the money – and there are &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/01/tongariro-alpine-crossing/"&gt;other places&lt;/a&gt; that are much more&amp;nbsp;spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Milford Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our base in &lt;a href="http://www.yha.co.nz/hostels/south-island-hostels/yha-te-anau/"&gt;Te Anau&lt;/a&gt;, we headed off to Milford Sound along State Highway 94 which is regarded as one of the highest and most scenic highways in New Zealand. There is a number of short sidewalks which are definitely worth stopping such as The Mirror Lakes or The Chasm but just drive itself through the glacial Eglinton Valley is&amp;nbsp;spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we reached the Homer Tunnel, the traffic started to be quite dense as the tunnel was only one way and operated by a traffic light. About 1200m long tunnel hewed from solid granite had nothing to do with those wide, smooth tunnels in the Alps in&amp;nbsp;Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Waiting for our cruise at departure terminal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Milford Sound shortly after midday and as the traffic around the tunnel indicated, the place was really busy and crowded. Boats of different operators were taking turns at the harbour and any minute we could hear a noise of small scenic planes in the air. I was at the place about 10 years ago and I don’t remember such a&amp;nbsp;buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heading off to the Tasman Sea" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Heading off to the Tasman Sea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While waiting for our cruise, we made an easy 20 minute loop through beech forest and along shore with some nice views of the fjord and surrounding peaks. But then we were ready to hop on &lt;a href="http://www.mitrepeak.com"&gt;our boat&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy the&amp;nbsp;cruise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The amazing weather highlighted the beauty of the sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The amazing weather highlighted the beauty of the sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip lasted about two hours and from harbour we cruised about 16 km to the open Tasman Sea. Straight at the beginning, we passed a massive Bowen Falls and the iconic Mitre Peak. We spotted a few fur seal colonies lying on the rocks. Once we reached St. Anne’s lighthouse and got to open sea, the waves were quite rough and our boat swung a lot. Luckily, our skipper didn’t let us suffer too long and after few minutes turned the boat back to the harbour. We concluded the cruise with the spray from Stirling Falls as the bout tried to approach it as close as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="We got a bit of spray from Stirling Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;We got a bit of spray from Stirling Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had not even absorbed the Milford Sound experience yet and we were already heading off to Lake Manapouri, where we started our &lt;a href="http://www.goorange.co.nz/doubtful-sound/the-cruise/"&gt;full day cruise to Doubtful Sound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;On the way to Doubtful Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started with an early and quiet cruise across Lake Manapouri to the West Arm Visitor Centre where we got some interesting information about the adjacent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manapouri_Power_Station"&gt;Underground Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. From there, we carried on by coach over Wilmot Pass into Doubtful Sound. In the morning, we were a bit in a rush but in the afternoon, on the way back, our driver made a few stops along this section, so we had enough time to wander around and enjoy all&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The silence and calm were amazing" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The silence and calm were amazing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the day started at Dove Cove where we got on board and cruised again about 30 km to the open Tasman Sea. We slowly sailed between tiny islands which reminded turtles lying on the water surface and big peaks which reminded an elephant’s&amp;nbsp;head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An elephant - do you see it too?" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An elephant - do you see it too?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got closer to the mouth of sound we chanced on fur seals. Later, on the way back, we met a few others that were excluded from their colonies to bulk themselves. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any luck to see penguins or&amp;nbsp;dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="It was a bit windy sometimes, but we had a lot of fun" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;It was a bit windy sometimes, but we had a lot of fun&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely a good decision to go with the first early cruise option because there were  no other boats and everything around looked quiet and calm, so we could fully enjoy that isolation. It was such a big contrast to busy Milford Sound and, eventually, it was also the reason why we preferred Doubtful Sound in the final&amp;nbsp;rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I’d heard about &lt;a href="http://www.qctrack.co.nz/on-the-track-/walk-the-track/"&gt;this track&lt;/a&gt; was when a friend of mine sent me an article from National Geographic about a selection of world’s best hikes. After a short discussion, we booked a ferry, bought &lt;a href="http://www.qctrack.co.nz/track-info/qctlc-pass/"&gt;passes for access&lt;/a&gt; to private land and then just hoped for a good&amp;nbsp;weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="On board on the way to Ship Cove" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;On board on the way to Ship Cove&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, we boarded a ferry and headed off to South Island. The sea was much calmer than the last time when we were on the way back to Wellington from our Christmas holiday and when a half of passengers on board was&amp;nbsp;sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the night in one of &lt;a href="http://www.yha.co.nz/hostels/south-island-hostels/yha-picton/"&gt;Picton’s backpackers&lt;/a&gt; and the next morning we and our big backpacks were ready to set off. The sun was shining and the cruise on the boat which took us to the beginning of the track was a great start of the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of farmland at Kenepuru Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of farmland at Kenepuru Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our hike at Ship Cove and planned to stay in campsites located on the ridge, so we took all our stuff with us. A tent, sleeping bags, food and camping gear for three days – our bags probably weighed about 12&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infinite blueness" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Infinite blueness&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were planning the track, I assumed that as it runs along the coast and the highest peak is about 400 m asl., the hike wouldn’t be difficult. The distances supposed to be long but elevation should be fine. I was wrong. The first day, we climbed about 1400 m in total as the path ran up and down all the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A path through enchanted forest" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A path through enchanted forest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to Furneaux Lodge, where we were going to catch a water taxi across Endeavour Inlet to Punga Cove, we walked through the cooling native forest and passed a few amazing lookouts with views of small&amp;nbsp;bays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The first lookout reached" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first lookout reached&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section between Punga Cove and a campsite at Bay of Many Coves was a bit struggle. I had sore feet because of too thick socks, was stung by a wasp and, in general, it was quite a long day. Therefore, we hesitated a little whether to do or not to do a side track to Eatwell’s Lookout. So lucky that we did it because the 360-degree view from the lookout was absolutely&amp;nbsp;stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A signpost at Eatwell’s lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, the track followed the ridge line with views over both Queen Charlotte Sound and Kenepuru Sound. At selected locations along the track, there are nice new benches made from massive wood where you can enjoy a view. During our breaks, most of the time, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka"&gt;fearless wekas&lt;/a&gt; kept us&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was just shortly after midday when we reached Torea Saddle, we decided to carry on and spent the night at &lt;a href="http://www.mistletoebay.co.nz/"&gt;Mistletoe Bay campsite&lt;/a&gt; which would save us some time the next day when we would rush to catch a water taxi back to Picton. We regretted this decision a little bit as we scrambled up to the highest point on the track which, however, made it up to us with more great&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A short refreshment before descend to Torea Saddle" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A short refreshment before descend to Torea Saddle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we descended from the summit, we met a man who was working on track maintenance. It was an interesting character that was really keen on holding a philosophical conversation about where the world is aiming to. After a half an hour we left enriched with a few latin expressions (which were a bit wrong as Jakub realised&amp;nbsp;later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Kenepuru Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Towards Kenepuru Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final descent to the Mistletoe Bay Campsite was quite exhausting as we followed a steep shortcut which ran along not a well-maintained path and at one point we were afraid that we would have to turn back and climb it all the way back. Luckily, after a while, we reached the sealed road and, eventually, the campsite as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Another tiny bay" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Another tiny bay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were only 4 hours of walking left for the last day. After the initial climb from Mistletoe Bay, the track ran quite easily along the same contour line before it descended back to the coastline. In spite of that, it seemed to us like ages before we finally got to&amp;nbsp;Anakiwa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view on the way to Anakiwa" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
