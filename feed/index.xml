    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/12.jpg" alt="Vietnam&amp;#58; Tam Coc and Cuc Phuong" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I had ambitions that we would organize the two-day trip to Tam Coc and Cuc Phuong on our own with the help of public transport. Yet, our laziness prevailed and we bought a tour which was offered at our&amp;nbsp;accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A bridge to the ancient capital" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A bridge to the ancient capital&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning, a guide picked us up at the hotel and with five other passengers, we hit the road to Ninh Binh city. It was a few hours long drive and after a couple of hours, we made a break at cafe/souvenir shop. It was one of those places where every tour group stops and prices are million times higher than everywhere else. A classic tourist&amp;nbsp;trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/15.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A whole area is an archaeological site" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/15.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A whole area is an archaeological site&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About midday we arrived in Ninh Binh area and our first stop was at Hoa Lu. Hoa Lu was the ancient capital city of Vietnamese kingdom called Dai Co Viet in the 10th century. A nice bridge led over the river to the entrance gate where a man offered taking a picture with his buffalo. For a small donation of&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/17.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A buffalo business" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/17.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A buffalo business&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area, there was a number of temples, pagodas and courts. Inside temples, the statues of kings were surrounded by piles of offerings and everything was wrapped in veils of incense. The complex was surrounded by limestone hills which back in the past had provided protection against Chinese&amp;nbsp;invaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our guide, we also learn a bit about history and old&amp;nbsp;dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/18.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shipping spot for ride at Tam Coc" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/18.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Shipping spot for ride at Tam Coc&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we moved on to Tam Coc. We had lunch at &lt;a href="http://thelongrestaurant.com/"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; nearby the lake but it was average, nothing&amp;nbsp;special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we got on small boats and rowers took us for two hours ride. Tam Coc is said to be a miniature landlocked version of Ha Long Bay. Our boat slowly peddled through the landscape of karst hills with rice paddies on sides. We went through three low-level tunnel caves which were eroded through the limestone hills and during rainy seasons are barely&amp;nbsp;passable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/26.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bright green colour of rice fields" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/26.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bright green colour of rice fields&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is a popular touristic spot, so even along canals, there are boats loaded with snacks and drinks and ready to attack passing boats. And of course, the rowers expected a tip at the end of the ride (on the top of the tickets we’d bought). My mom and brother totally overpaid their rower, so he said goodbye to them with a shiny smile on his face. On the other hand, our rower would have rather seen us down in the&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/23.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of the three caves we passed through" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/23.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the three caves we passed through&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the night we stayed in a hotel somewhere in Ninh Binh. In the evening we went to explore the city but except a nice park with a Buddhist temple and a lookout with grey smog view, there was not much and the city didn’t impress&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day morning, after a few nervous moments, wondering whether our guide forgot about us and we would have to find our own way back to Hanoi, we set off to Cuc Phuong. Only with an hour&amp;nbsp;delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/31.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Somewhere at Cuc Phuong National Park" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/31.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Somewhere at Cuc Phuong National Park&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuc Phuong is the Vietnam’s first national park. Walks within the park allowed to explore the rainforest and the life in it. After we arrived to the park, firstly, we visited a primal rescue center where we saw all the different monkey species. While adults were lazily sitting on tree branches, babies were jumping and playing&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few meters from there, there was a smaller turtle center. It was rather the informational center referring to attempts which had been made to increasing the number of those endangered animals but they had a few living pieces crawling around too.  Apparently, turtles are a pricey item on the black&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/29.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An ancient tree" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/29.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An ancient tree&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the park, we made two short walks to ancient trees. Walks were a bit overgrown and muddy – which kind of made sense – it was a rainforest. Still, two young guys who were part of our group set off in flip flops. It wasn’t the best choice for steep slippery&amp;nbsp;parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had lunch in a remote restaurant which looked more like a shelter in the middle of nowhere but meals were absolutely&amp;nbsp;delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cold but exciting!" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-tam-coc-and-cuc-phuong/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cold but exciting!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the afternoon we spent on the way back to &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2017/06/27/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;. In the evening we were going to get on a train and head off up north to Sapa region for few days. But about that – next&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/92.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/92.jpg" alt="Vietnam&amp;#58; Bun Cha in Hanoi" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been planning this trip for a while. A lot of inspiration and useful information we found on Czech website &lt;a href="http://www.vietnamista.cz/"&gt;Vietnamista&lt;/a&gt;. It also helped us to sort out our visa, so after arrival, we didn’t have problems at immigration and everything went&amp;nbsp;smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After meeting with two other members of our group at the airport, withdrawing local money from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; and a bit of struggling during buying a local sim card (Viettel) we finally headed off to our accommodation in central&amp;nbsp;Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/103.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The smell of burning incense accompanied us everywhere" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/103.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The smell of burning incense accompanied us everywhere&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first night, we’d booked rooms in &lt;a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/luminous-viet.cs.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-1FCA4oggJCAlhYSAViBW5vcmVmaK4BiAEBmAEFwgEKd2luZG93cyAxMMgBDNgBAegBAfgBBpICAXmoAgM;sid=095d466a6b99e95958ef967f846213c1;dest_id=-3714993;dest_type=city;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hip_dst=1;hpos=1;no_rooms=1;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;srfid=ed025e83e2d05bb99dff3974404f1e60b362805fX1;type=total;ucfs=1&amp;amp;#hotelTmpl"&gt;Luminous Viet Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. The hotel was located in the Old Town center and rooms were nice, so eventually we stayed there for two other nights during our trip. Unfortunately, the third night we were not cautious enough, didn’t check the rooms and ended up with one room without windows. Lesson learned – always check the rooms beforehand, even if staying at the same place&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The entrance to Ngoc Son Temple" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The entrance to Ngoc Son Temple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day we spent wandering through the Old Town of Hanoi. The first impression was terrifying. An uncoordinated jungle of honking motorbikes and cars scared us and every single street crossing was like struggle for life. Even at a properly marked crossing with a traffic light, the situation wasn’t much better. However, after a while, we adjusted and followed the locals. One important rule – do not run across the road. It’s safer to keep going, slowly, and everybody gets around&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Flowers, fruit and fake money are the most common offerings" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Flowers, fruit and fake money are the most common offerings&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked to Lake Hoan Kiem and visited &lt;a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/hanoi/attractions/ngoc-son-temple/a/poi-sig/398071/357880"&gt;Ngoc Son Temple&lt;/a&gt;. It was located on a little island and as a Buddhist temple, it was full of flowers, fruit and other offerings which people brought there. It’s a famous touristic place which corresponded with crowds of people fighting for the best&amp;nbsp;picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we strolled to St Joseph Cathedral and then further to the &lt;a href="http://www.hanoitoursvietnam.com/Hanoi-Tourist-Sites/hoa-lo-prison-museum-the-hanoi-hilton.html"&gt;Hoa Lo Prison Museum&lt;/a&gt; which was an interesting insight into the Vietnam&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Inside Hoa Lo Prison Museum&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we came back to Hanoi later that week for one more day, our next stop was Temple of Literature - Văn Mieu - Quốc Tu Giam. This temple, which is also the oldest Vietnamese university, is dedicated to Confucius. It’s a beautiful large complex with a lake, courts and parks and peaceful compared to what’s happening outside its&amp;nbsp;walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/91.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The entrance to Văn Mieu - Quốc Tu Giam" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/91.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The entrance to Văn Mieu - Quốc Tu Giam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not far away from there was One Pillar Pagoda – Chua Mot Cot. It’s a small but one of the most famous temples in Vietnam. Standing in the middle of a little pond, the temple should remind a lotus&amp;nbsp;blossom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/97.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pagoda represents a lotus flower growing up out of the water" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/97.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Pagoda represents a lotus flower growing up out of the water&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few steps away is Ho Chi Minh Museum and Mausoleum. We skipped visits of both of those places but interesting was that because of lunch break, all pathways around mausoleum were closed and guarded. Whoever came near the signs was promptly chased&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/99.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum -- no entrance during lunch break" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/99.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum &amp;#8211; no entrance during lunch break&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we headed back to the Old Town we visited Tran Quoc Pagoda. It was located on a small peninsula surrounded by West Lake. We arrived just in the middle of a ceremony which was sung via speakers and echoed all around the&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/104.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gathering at Tran Quoc Pagoda during the prayer" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/104.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Gathering at Tran Quoc Pagoda during the prayer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up our stay in Hanoi with an evening performance in &lt;a href="http://thanglongwaterpuppet.org/en/"&gt;Water Puppet Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. The performance which lasted about 45 minutes consisted of several short stories and was accompanied by traditional Vietnamese music. Later our guide told us that it’s an attraction only for kids and tourists but we liked it&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/109.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Water Puppet Show" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/vietnam-bun-cha-in-hanoi/109.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Water Puppet Show&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole different chapter could be dedicated to Vietnamese cuisine. For our first lunch, we tried a Hanoi specialty – &lt;a href="https://www.roughguides.com/article/10-vietnamese-foods-you-need-to-try/"&gt;bun cha&lt;/a&gt;. We heard stories that tourists get easy food poisoned in Asia, so initially, we wanted to take it easy and eat somewhere decent the first day. But our plans had changed as we were passing all kind of street restaurants and they all smelled great. A restaurant is actually not a right word. It was usually an eatery, right on the street with a few tiny plastic tables, stools, and a boiling pot right next to it. Eventually, we ended up at one of those trying not to think about hygiene.  We were the only foreigners there but it was a good sign in the end because the food was delicious! And we survived without any digestion&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2017/06/18/kepler-track/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/7.jpg" alt="Kepler Track" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Great Walks need to be planned well ahead and the same stands for the &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/keplertrack"&gt;Kepler Track&lt;/a&gt; which is one of them. It is the 3-4 day walk, so we booked our hut tickets already in October for a long weekend in January. Unfortunately, campsites, which count for a cheaper accommodation option on Great Walks, are not well spread along the Kepler Track. Given the fortune we spent for hut tickets and flights, we really hoped for good weather, despite the bad weather&amp;nbsp;forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Luxmore Hut - our first night destination" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Luxmore Hut - our first night destination&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday we walked through the airport gate without any troubles even though our carry on backpacks weighed a bit over 7kg. Luckily, nobody checked&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dunedin, we picked up our El Cheapo from &lt;a href="https://www.jucy.co.nz"&gt;Jucy&lt;/a&gt; and carried on to Balclutha where we were going to stay the night. We knew about a nice &lt;a href="http://balcluthamotorcamp.co.nz"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; there as we’d already stayed there during our Christmas&amp;nbsp;travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/36.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Almost as a mirror" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/36.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Almost as a mirror&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, when we approached Te Anau, the surrounding hills were covered by clouds. Once it started to drizzle, our last hopes for good weather had just&amp;nbsp;vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/31.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lake Manapouri beach" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/31.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lake Manapouri beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Te Anau, we walked to &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/fiordland-national-park-visitor-centre/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOC&lt;/span&gt; center&lt;/a&gt; to pick up hut tickets and get their latest weather advice. It wasn’t good at all. A lot of rain and strong wind but apparently not bad enough to close the&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The first part to Brod Bay campsite was flat and easy" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first part to Brod Bay campsite was flat and easy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we headed off. The first part of the track ran through beech forest along the shore of Lake Te Anau. At Brod Bay campsite the track turned away from the lake and we started to climb up. I was annoyed. All that effort ahead and money we spent for nothing. No more than rubbish views and wet clothes. After a while, my mumbling and complaining annoyed even Jakub. Moreover, blisters appeared on my heels. On the first day.&amp;nbsp;Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jakub posing with limestone" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jakub posing with limestone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed a massive limestone bluff before we got above bushline. It was a moment when we should have enjoyed panoramic views. What we really experienced was total mist and views of few meters&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view above bushline -- not much" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view above bushline &amp;#8211; not much&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 45 minutes we reached the Luxmore Hut. While having a snack we got a bit warm and as there still was plenty of daylight we went to explore Luxmore Caves which were nearby. A few stairs led down to the cave entrance and with a torch we could go quite deep into the cave. Definitely worth those 10 minutes walk from the&amp;nbsp;hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view got better later in the evening" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view got better later in the evening&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the evening the clouds raised up and we had a better view of the lake Te Anau and surrounding hills. However, a hut ranger didn’t put our hopes for better weather too high during his evening hut&amp;nbsp;talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/14.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The second day on the ridge was tough with gusts over 100km/hr" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/14.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The second day on the ridge was tough with gusts over 100km/hr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, he confirmed his predictions with the comment “It’s pretty brutal up there.” and added that groups with young kids should consider returning back to Te&amp;nbsp;Anau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After thinking it through over the breakfast and reassuring with the ranger twice that it would be tough but not dangerous, we set out&amp;nbsp;ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A desperate smile" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A desperate smile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we left the hut, a cold wind hit our faces. It was strong but luckily most of the time we were sheltered behind the ridge. We rejected a side climb to Mt Luxmore summit and headed to the Forest Burn Shelter instead. On the way, we passed a number of other people and surprisingly even a group with small&amp;nbsp;kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section between Forest Burn Shelter and Hanging Valley Shelter was rough. There were patches of snow on the path, it started to rain (horizontally thanks to the wind) and the temperature dropped down below zero due to wind chill factor. My trousers were covered with an icy&amp;nbsp;crust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/15.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Little waterfalls were everywhere in the forest " src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/15.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Little waterfalls were everywhere in the forest &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part was when we were passing one of the exposed saddles. The strong wind that rushed up through​ the valley along with gusts with speed over 100km/h made it really hard to stand on the narrow pathway. In the middle of the crossing, I suddenly saw Jakub’s backpack cover being blown away. At that point, I was quite scared and was thinking about going&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when we got over that section the conditions calmed down a bit and we reached the Hanging Valley Shelter in about 10 minutes. There, we met a couple who came from the other side of the track and they assured us the wind wasn’t so bad over&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The best view of the second day with Lake Manapouri on the horizon" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The best view of the second day with Lake Manapouri on the horizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the following part when we descended along the ridge to the Iris Burn Hut provided some good views of the valley and Lake Manapouri. Finally, the more pleasant half of the track&amp;nbsp;began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/19.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Iris Burn waterfall" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/19.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Iris Burn waterfall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iris Burn Hut was situated in a large tussock clearing and there were no signs of terrible weather which troubled us on the ridge. Inside the hut, a wood burner made it nice and warm. Refreshed and with dry clothes, we went to Iris Burn falls which was a 20 minutes side trip from the&amp;nbsp;hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guide leaflet referred to the waterfall as a place suitable for a dip but after plenty of rain in the last few days, the waterfall was a quite massive and too whirling even for famous blue&amp;nbsp;ducks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/21.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A little friend" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/21.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A little friend&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we listened to an interesting hut talk during which a ranger tried to imitate sounds of kiwi. His performance was a bit weird but it was authentic enough that later in the night when I woke up and heard a similar noise I knew it was a kiwi out there.&amp;nbsp;Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/25.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jakub having a dip in the Lake Manapouri" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/25.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jakub having a dip in the Lake Manapouri&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day the track took us over an easily graded saddle, we passed a location where heavy rains caused a large slip in January 1984 before walked through lowland beech forest. We were almost eaten by sand flies during our lunch on side of Iris Burn. Early in the afternoon, we reached the shore of Lake Manapouri. While Jakub was having a refreshing dip, I enjoyed the sunshine. The Moturau Hut was located only a few hundred meters further and in the evening we observed a beautiful sunset over the lake on the&amp;nbsp;beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/28.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunset at the Lake Manapouri" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/28.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sunset at the Lake Manapouri&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last day was a bit struggle as our legs were wobbly after previous 3 days and 45km. The section walked across flat wetland and then followed the Waiau River. From swing bridge at Rainbow Reach, which was an optional end of the track, we still had 10km to finish the track. Despite aching feet, we refused to take a shuttle, clenched our teeth and carried&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/35.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A wetland area on the way to Rainbow Reach" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/35.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A wetland area on the way to Rainbow Reach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a real relief when we finally passed control gates at Te Anau Lake and got to our car after four&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/kepler-track/40.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The last 10km to finish" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/kepler-track/40.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The last 10km to finish&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the trip was not a waste of money. Those four days had everything – a lot of rain and a bit of sun, some wind and frost, little drama and enough fun. And most importantly, when we looked back we’d survived and enjoyed it&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/129.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/129.jpg" alt="Routeburn Track" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2016, we were planning our Christmas travel and we decided to take the advantage of being down in South Island and do another Great Walk. After &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/11/15/tongariro-northern-circuit/"&gt;Tongariro Northern Circuit&lt;/a&gt; it was going to be our second one. As the Kepler Track hut tickets were already sold out for suitable dates and the Milford Track was hopelessly booked out for the rest of the season, we chose the &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/routeburntrack"&gt;Routeburn track&lt;/a&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/96.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Full of energy at the beginning of the track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/96.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Full of energy at the beginning of the track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Routeburn track is a one-way walk, so after deciding which way we would go, we needed to sort out our transportation. We started the track from The Divide and finished it at Routeburn Shelter. We considered different options, compared prices and eventually chose car relocation with &lt;a href="http://www.easyhike.co.nz/routeburn-track/routeburn-track-car-relocation/"&gt;Easy Hike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/106.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of rare clear views on the track -- Hollyford Valley" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/106.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of rare clear views on the track &amp;#8211; Hollyford Valley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before the track we stayed in &lt;a href="http://teanauholidaypark.co.nz/"&gt;Te Anau&lt;/a&gt;. In the morning, we went to do some final shopping and picked up a locker for a car key. We’d never done this type of car relocation before and after we got a little magnetic box which we supposed to snap to the bottom of the car, we could do nothing but hope that we would see our car ever&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/140.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Route Burn Valley before descent to Routeburn Falls Hut -- our lunch break spot" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/140.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Route Burn Valley before descent to Routeburn Falls Hut &amp;#8211; our lunch break spot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather in Te Anau wasn’t bad but as we were getting closer to The Divide, the surrounding hills got covered by clouds and it started to drizzle a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off the track shortly after noon. Over the night, we were going to stay at Lake Mackenzie campsite which was about 4 hours of walk away. No need to rush&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/97.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The first stop on the track -- Lake Howden" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/97.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first stop on the track &amp;#8211; Lake Howden&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track ascended gradually and in 45 min we came to the junction to Key Summit. That is said to be a popular side track with a beautiful view but as the visibility was poor that day, we skipped it and carried on to Lake&amp;nbsp;Howden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/103.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of the numerous streams on the way" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/103.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the numerous streams on the way&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bench, in front of the hut at Lake Howden, we had a small snack. But shortly we rather carried on moving because a big guided group of people was just about finishing their fancy muffins and got ready to go too and we wanted to avoid any walking in&amp;nbsp;queues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/100.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The mystic Earland falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/100.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The mystic Earland falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the next section of the track, the clouds cleared up a bit now and then and we had a better view of hills on the other side of Hollyford valley. Unfortunately, just when we reached the Earland Falls one of the clouds covered the mountain and we could hardly see the top of the&amp;nbsp;waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when we reached an open grassy area called “Orchard” even sun came out and we could fully enjoy the sunshine. The Orchard looked like an amazing place for camping but “No Camping” signs are located at both ends of this lovely&amp;nbsp;section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/105.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The weather got slightly better when we reached The Orchard" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/105.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The weather got slightly better when we reached The Orchard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Lake Mackenzie, we arrived at the hut first. The campsite was located about 10 minutes further but notes around the hut clearly informed that campers are not allowed to use hut facilities. We were a bit surprised by such a differentiation between campers and hut guests. Especially because during our time at Tongariro Northern Circuit we stayed at the campsite but we were allowed to use the huts for cooking or&amp;nbsp;chilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/112.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Our overnight spot - Lake Mackenzie campsite" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/112.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our overnight spot - Lake Mackenzie campsite&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the campsite, there was only one other tent but by the dusk, the area was fully&amp;nbsp;packed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before dinner, we explored the area around the lake. There is a short side trip to Split Rock. From the rock, the orange triangle signs led to the edge of the lake. The path was a bit overgrown and sometimes we had to struggle through branches but it was worth it because the lake shore was&amp;nbsp;charming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/117.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Last few moments with good weather while climbing up from Lake Mackenzie" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/117.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Last few moments with good weather while climbing up from Lake Mackenzie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning we set off early as we were going to finish the rest of the track and still had planned to drive a bit further north before we would find a campsite for the&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section from Lake Mackenzie up to the hill was the only arduous ascend on the track. But once we climbed to a certain level, we easily traversed the exposed Hollyford Face. In good weather, according to our guide book, this part provides wonderful views over the Darran Mountains. Unfortunately, we walked in a total fog and didn’t see further than a few&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/118.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara and … the fog" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/118.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara and … the fog&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we passed Harris Saddle and on the other side of the ridge, the situation got finally better because all the clouds were caught by hills. There was a small shelter at Harris Saddle which was an ideal place for a&amp;nbsp;snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/130.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dark blue waters of Lake Harris" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/130.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Dark blue waters of Lake Harris&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section of the track was really stunning. The track ran above black waters of Lake Harris and we enjoyed views of jagged mountains all around. Further behind the lake, we could see a high waterfall falling out from Lake&amp;nbsp;Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/135.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The winding Route Burn stream and its amazing valley" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/135.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The winding Route Burn stream and its amazing valley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way down to Routeburn Falls Hut, we descended along a cascading stream which escalated into an impressive gorge and a beautiful combination of waterfalls right next to the hut. The hut was almost empty as all the people left already and we had a quiet lunch in a communal&amp;nbsp;kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/136.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jakub safely covered under rock shelter" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/136.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jakub safely covered under rock shelter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Routeburn Falls Hut we descended steadily through beech forest and passed a few small waterfalls before we made a turn to Routeburn Flats Hut – our last stop on the track. The hut was on the edge of open grassy area with access to the river and views of the Humboldt&amp;nbsp;Mountains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/145.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Routeburn Flats and view of Humboldt Mountains in the background" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/145.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Routeburn Flats and view of Humboldt Mountains in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the track ran through the forest along the open area before it went over a swing bridge and then it winded above the gorge. Frankly, that section was a bit tedious and too long, so we were quite happy when we finally reached the carpark after a couple of&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/routeburn-track/147.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Route Burn stream crossing" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/routeburn-track/147.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Route Burn stream crossing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we were even happier when we saw our relocated&amp;nbsp;car!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transport&lt;/strong&gt;: car, ferry,&amp;nbsp;walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost a three-weeks long Christmas break spent in South Island of New&amp;nbsp;Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, we cruised by ferry and then drove further down south along the Inland Route, an alternative way after the earthquake in November 2016, where we met with our friends in Fairlie. Spending most of that time together, we explored the South Island’s landscape during sunny and rainy days, had a Christmas day &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBQ&lt;/span&gt;, celebrated New Year’s Eve and the most importantly had a great&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After New Year’s Eve our journeys split and from Glenorchy, we headed off down south to Catlins. Driving along Southland Scenic Route we admired rough coastline, wildlife (yes, we finally saw penguins!), amazing rainforest and heaps of&amp;nbsp;waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We completed our trip with the &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/routeburntrack"&gt;Routeburn Track&lt;/a&gt;, one of nine &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/things-to-do/walking-and-tramping/great-walks/"&gt;Great Walks&lt;/a&gt; and survived more than a nine-hours long drive back to Picton where we boarded on the midnight ferry and got back to&amp;nbsp;Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/h2&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/7.jpg" alt="Mt Holdsworth Jumbo Circuit" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/holdsworthjumbocircuit"&gt;Mt Holdsworth Jumbo Circuit&lt;/a&gt; is a classic tramp in Tararuas and we had been planning to undertake it for ages. Unfortunately, the mountain range is afflicted by strong winds for most of the year and as the best part of the track follows an exposed ridge, it might be quite dangerous with gusts well over 100&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An exposed ridge can be quite windy -- over 100km/h is pretty common" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An exposed ridge can be quite windy &amp;#8211; over 100km/h is pretty common&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, we had been waiting and hoping that one day the good weather would come. Eventually, after a few previous cancellations, a window of sunny three days&amp;nbsp;appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A start of the track is about an hour and a half drive from Wellington. The track can be done in one day but we decided to split it into two and stay over the night at &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/tararua-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/jumbo-hut/"&gt;Jumbo Hut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The green hills of Tararuas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off early. After signing into a visitor book at Holdsworth Lodge, we carried on along a steep path of Gentle Annie Track. A fresh crispy air cooled us down but not quickly enough because once we reached the Rocky Lookout, a short side trip from the main track, we were both&amp;nbsp;sweat-drenched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Rocky Lookout defeated!" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Rocky Lookout defeated!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rocky Lookout offered nice views of Wairarapa below and on the other side, above the bush line, we could see &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/tararua-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/powell-hut/"&gt;Powell Hut&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/03/30/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/"&gt;lunch break&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The view over Wairarapa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the track ascended gradually up to Mountain House Shelter which used to be a proper mountain hut back in the days. From there, it rose steeply up to the hill and we had to climb a number of steps before we got above the dense&amp;nbsp;bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it was a beautiful day, there was nobody around Powell Hut. It was a really good timing because just a few minutes after we had left, a helicopter started to supply the hut with&amp;nbsp;firewood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/14.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A narrow ridge leading to Jumbo Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/14.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A narrow ridge leading to Jumbo Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Powell Hut the track followed the ridge up to the Mt Holdsworth trig which offered great views of Wairarapa on one side and Tararua Range on the other. In the distance, the dense white clouds were rolling over the hills like giant waves falling down into deep&amp;nbsp;valleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The rolling clouds in the distance" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The rolling clouds in the distance&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we descended from the peak and carried on to Jumbo Hut, the cloud reached Mt Holdsworth and covered it entirely disabling any views. We felt sorry for a bunch of people who passed us in the opposite direction and were heading to the&amp;nbsp;summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="There used to be the Mt Holdsworth summit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/13.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There used to be the Mt Holdsworth summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section between Mt Holdsworth and Jumbo Peak was quite challenging. Despite the favourable weather, the wind gusts along the ridge were strong and the path leading among tussock was hardly recognizable. Besides that, as there had been some heavy rain a few days before, it was really&amp;nbsp;muddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Jumbo Peak, we enjoyed some more amazing views but as the clouds started to roll over the nearest hills, we didn’t stay for long and rather quickly carried on to Jumbo&amp;nbsp;Hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/17.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The clouds were getting closer and closer" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/17.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The clouds were getting closer and closer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other people made use of nice weather and at the end of the evening, the hut was almost full. It’s always interesting to see what other people are willing to carry in their backpacks. This time it was a pocket version of board game Settlers of Catan, a big lolly bag and hot chocolate (surprisingly no&amp;nbsp;marshmallows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/22.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The sunrise at Jumbo Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/22.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The sunrise at Jumbo Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning, after a half of the people met in front of the hut to watch the sunrise, we set off to finish the rest of the&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/30.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fields of gold" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/30.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fields of gold&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steep descent to Atiwhakatu Hut was quite tiring, especially for our knees but once we got there, the track ran along the river with an easy&amp;nbsp;grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/32.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The amazing forest on the way to Atiwhakatu Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/32.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The amazing forest on the way to Atiwhakatu Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed a couple of junctions with alternative ways to Mt Holdsworth and after a few kilometers reached the one where we had made the first turn to Gentle Annie Track the previous&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/34.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Atiwhakatu Stream near the hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/34.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Atiwhakatu Stream near the hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before we arrived at the car park, we walked through the last section of the track, the Donnelly Flat, which is also a great area for picnics and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBQ&lt;/span&gt; as there are fire pits&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/39.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A good wrap up was essential in the chilly morning" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/39.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A good wrap up was essential in the chilly morning&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it was worth waiting all that time until the weather was reasonable because we could fully enjoy this gem of Tararuas. Definitely&amp;nbsp;recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/9.jpg" alt="Tongariro Northern Circuit" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food is neatly sorted out into single zip bags, clothes and a tent are in backpacks. Our four-wheel hotel is ready to go. After we’d made the very popular &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/01/tongariro-alpine-crossing/"&gt;Tongariro Alpine Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to use one of the long weekends and undertake the less touristic &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/central-north-island/places/tongariro-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/tongariro-northern-circuit/"&gt;Tongariro Northern Circuit&lt;/a&gt;. Our first Great&amp;nbsp;Walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Late summer and there is still some snow on top of Mt Ruapehu" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Late summer and there is still some snow on top of Mt Ruapehu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a four hours long drive, we arrived at &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/central-north-island/places/tongariro-national-park/things-to-do/campsites/mangahuia-campsite/"&gt;Mangahuia campsite&lt;/a&gt; where we spent the night. The campground had all necessary facilities and also plenty of space. The more we were surprised when we woke up and there was another car parked right next to&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beginning of the Tongariro Northern Circuit -- Bara is fresh and excited" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Beginning of the Tongariro Northern Circuit &amp;#8211; Bara is fresh and excited&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we drove over to Whakapapa Village where the track begins. We were going to walk the circuit anti-clockwise but it is possible to make it in either&amp;nbsp;direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Already well-known Taranaki Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Already well-known Taranaki Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sections to Taranaki Falls as well as to Tama Lakes were easy and even with heavy backpacks the distance went quickly by. We’d already known those sections from our previous &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/06/07/tama-lakes/"&gt;winter trips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The historic Maihohonu hut -- the oldest existing mountain hut in New Zealand" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The historic Maihohonu hut &amp;#8211; the oldest existing mountain hut in New Zealand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path led among tussock and shrubs and on the right-hand side Mt Ruapehu hid its snow-covered top in gray clouds. All the way to historic Waihohonu Hut we hardly met any other&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunset at Waihohonu Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sunset at Waihohonu Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at new Waihohonu Hut, the place we were going to stay over the night, we still had a plenty of time for a side trip to Ohinepango Springs. The springs bubbling up from the old lava flow were only 30min walk from the hut. By the time we went back for dinner, the clouds cleared up a bit and the sky turned into an amazing colorful sunset&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="It tasted better than it looked, especially after hours of hiking" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;It tasted better than it looked, especially after hours of hiking&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Waihohonu campsite was located a few meters down from the hut and it was set up right next to the stream which made a relaxing burbling background for&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mt Ruapehu again, this time with clear sky" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mt Ruapehu again, this time with clear sky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up to a beautiful sunny day. As it was going to be the most arduous day from all three, we hit the trail early. The path went up and down across stream valleys and our backpacks were definitely heavier than the previous&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara is still excited but not so fresh anymore" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara is still excited but not so fresh anymore&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parched gravel field spread all around with occasional plants and a perfect cone of Mt Ngauruhoe was in nice contrast with blue&amp;nbsp;sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A desert landscape on the way to Oturere Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A desert landscape on the way to Oturere Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about two hours we reached the Oturere Hut where we made a break and had some refreshment. We found out that staying in Oturere Hut for the first night would probably have been a more convenient option and would have made the second day much&amp;nbsp;easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A little pearl in the volcanic desert -- Gentiana bellidifolia" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A little pearl in the volcanic desert &amp;#8211; Gentiana bellidifolia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we carried on towards Emerald Lakes, the landscape changed again and the path weaves through jagged lava&amp;nbsp;formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section to Emerald lakes was a 200m altitude steep ascend and I think that we stopped every few meters to catch a breath. It was such a relieve when we finally got over the edge and spotted the&amp;nbsp;lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of Emerald lakes" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of Emerald lakes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, the track merged up with Tongariro Crossing track. The number of tourists rocketed and we watched them how they were slowly descending from Red Crater down to the Central Crater. Like a line of ants. As we crawled uphill, we had to be quite careful as some people moved a bit clumsily in loose volcanic&amp;nbsp;debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The weather had changed rapidly before we reached the Red Crater" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/13.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The weather had changed rapidly before we reached the Red Crater&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, by the time we reached the top of Red Crater, everything around had got covered by dense clouds and it started to drizzle. Despite our tiredness, we decided to do the side trip to Mt Tongariro summit as we skipped that one during our last time at &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/01/tongariro-alpine-crossing/"&gt;Tongariro Crossing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/14.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="See you later, backpacks" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/14.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;See you later, backpacks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately one and half hour return walk followed the ridge and required a few climbs over the rocks. When we got further from the busy junction with Tongariro Crossing trail, we just left our backpacks next to the one of rock formation and carried to the summit without them. We were suddenly about 12kg&amp;nbsp;lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/15.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Tongariro Summit Track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/15.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;View from Tongariro Summit Track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as we would have planned it, when we reached the summit the clouds cleared up and we had a great view of South Crater whose slopes created an amazing combination of all brown, orange and gray shades. On the other side was a totally different view of gradually sloping hill with valleys eroded by a number of the little&amp;nbsp;streams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/16.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Tongariro Summit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/16.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;View from Tongariro Summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning back to the junction, the main track steeply descended. We crossed the wide South Crater and then climbed down a number of steps before we reached Soda Springs. From there, it was already an easy 30 min walk on the wooden platform and in the distance we could see the roof of the Mangatepopo Hut – our final destination for the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/17.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A beautiful sunset at Mangatepopo Hut -- a reward for all our effort" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/17.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A beautiful sunset at Mangatepopo Hut &amp;#8211; a reward for all our effort&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day, we had to finish the last section between Mangatepopo Hut and Whakapapa Village. The weather was nice and from some points along the track, we had a nice view of surrounding volcanoes. But even though, it was probably the least exciting part of the whole track as most of the time the path led through dense shrub and we could not see&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/18.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lost in the shrubs" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/18.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lost in the shrubs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 3 hours, the track merged with Taranaki Falls track and we could cool our tired feet in Wairere stream before we finished the last bit and came to Whakapapa&amp;nbsp;Village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/19.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="For the last time -- Mt Ruapehu" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/19.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;For the last time &amp;#8211; Mt Ruapehu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the Tongariro Northern Circuit was definitely worth all the effort and sweating. With great views, fewer tourists on the track and nice camping spots we gave it our preference to its shorter Tongariro Alpine Crossing version. Definitely one of our most favorite hikes, so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/4.jpg" alt="Chilly hiking in Nelson Lakes National Park" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning we woke up in the tent which was totally covered with frost as the temperature during the night dropped down close to -8°C. Luckily for us, our sleeping bags stood this test without any problem and the only frozen parts of our bodies were our&amp;nbsp;noses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waiting for sunrise at Lake Rotoiti" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Waiting for sunrise at Lake Rotoiti&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were cooking breakfast, the fog was lazily rolling over Lake Rotoiti and the sun beams slowly lighted up the hillsides around. It seemed that another beautiful day was ahead of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Out of the breath on the top of St Arnaud Range" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Out of the breath on the top of St Arnaud Range&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d planned to undertake the &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/nelson-marlborough/nelson-lakes-short-walks-brochure.pdf"&gt;St Arnaud Range track&lt;/a&gt;. It started as a steady climb through beech forest but shortly changed to a tough steep ascent. The zigzag path seemed to be endless and the light shining through stunted trees always gave us the wishful thinking that we were close to the&amp;nbsp;top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The endless ascent through beech forest " src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The endless ascent through beech forest &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when we passed at least the fiftieth bend, we got above the bushline and reached Parachutes Rocks after a few minutes. What a view! All that sweat and pant were absolutely worth it. The blue waters of Lake Rotoiti glittered beneath and the snowy tops of Robert ridge where we’d walked &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/08/16/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/"&gt;the previous day&lt;/a&gt; stretched in front of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jakub pretending deep interest in views from Parachutes Rocks" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jakub pretending deep interest in views from Parachutes Rocks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short break, we carried on up to the ridge line. At first, we followed the path beaten in tussock but then, when it disappeared under the snow, we just followed the other hikers’ prints. As we were climbing up to the steep hill, I started to be a bit worried about how we would get back because some sections were pretty slippery. Moreover, we met a few really well-equipped hikers with crampons and ice axes who made the situation look even more&amp;nbsp;serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Amazing views of Nelson Lake area" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazing views of Nelson Lake area&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were getting closer to the top, I was really excited what’s on the other side of the ridge. The last few meters and we got there! The other side revealed the snow-covered Wairau Valley with small lakes in its basins. The 360-degree view of surrounding area was spectacular with all the green and white hills rolling on the&amp;nbsp;horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of the other side - snowy Wairau Valley" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the other side - snowy Wairau Valley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the way back wasn’t as bad as I’d thought and we got down without any problem. However, some people had decided that sliding the hill on their butts would be even “safer” way of descending. In the end, I was more worried about them than about&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Crossing the stream on the way to falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Crossing the stream on the way to falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we still had a half of the day before we had to head off back to Picton. We spent that time walking along the shore of the lake and in less than a couple of hours we reached &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/nelson-marlborough/nelson-lakes-short-walks-brochure.pdf"&gt;Whiskey falls&lt;/a&gt;. This almost 40 meters high waterfall was hidden among the trees and ferns just a few meters beside the main&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we enjoyed the last few views over Lake Rotoiti but then it was time to pack all the stuff and set out back to&amp;nbsp;Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/10.jpg" alt="Chilly camping in Nelson Lakes National Park" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Friday afternoon. Everything was packed and the car was ready. I printed last few maps, our ferry tickets and then we headed off to &lt;a href="https://www.interislander.co.nz/"&gt;Wellington ferry terminal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A quick warm-up while climbing up to Mt Robert" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A quick warm-up while climbing up to Mt Robert&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sign that something was wrong was that we were the only car at check-in. No queue as usual. At the gate, there was a notice that check-in would be an hour beyond its scheduled time. A bit annoyed, as we hadn’t received any notice, we drove to the terminal to find out what was going on. A few minutes later, all our weekend plans almost blew&amp;nbsp;up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Grass and mose still around but snow wasn't far" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Grass and mose still around but snow wasn&amp;#8217;t far&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, by mistake, I’d booked the tickets in the wrong direction and instead of in Wellington, they expected us to board in Picton. Within a sec, our annoyance turned into kindness as we tried to re-book our tickets at a counter and save heaps of money. Luckily, there were free spots on the next boat and a salesman was really nice. So eventually, we departed just with a little&amp;nbsp;delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A kingdom of ice and snow" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A kingdom of ice and snow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first night we spent in &lt;a href="http://www.yha.co.nz/hostels/south-island-hostels/yha-picton/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YHA&lt;/span&gt; in Picton&lt;/a&gt; and carried on to the Nelson Lakes the next day. In the morning, a fog rolled over Picton but by the time we arrived at St Arnaud, the sun was shining and the blue sky indicated a beautiful&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lake Rotoiti and our campground down there" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lake Rotoiti and our campground down there&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/footer-links/contact-us/office-by-name/?office=K1024"&gt;Nelson Lakes Visitor Centre&lt;/a&gt; we bought our campsite ticket and got information about track conditions as there was already snow on the top of the hills. We abandoned our intention to reach the Angelus Hut as equipment like crampons and ice axes were required. Later, we found out&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jakub - the mountaineer" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jakub - the mountaineer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the goal for the afternoon was &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/nelson-lakes-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/mount-robert-circuit/?region=nelsontasman&amp;amp;park=09e4a9dc-2578-433e-abb9-670c0794579b&amp;amp;activity=walking-tramping#activitypanel"&gt;Mt Robert Circuit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the chilly morning, the initial steep zigzag part of the track quickly warmed us up. Through beech forest we climbed up to the open ridge top which with its great views of Lake Rotoiti and hills all around served as an ideal place for our classic hiking lunch - &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/03/30/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/"&gt;cheese and crackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Green slopes and white tops of St Arnaud Range" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Green slopes and white tops of St Arnaud Range&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we passed Relax Shelter, patches of snow started appearing among clumps of grass. There was still plenty of daylight when we reached the junction to Paddy’s Track so we carried on a little bit further along the ridge towards Lake Angelus. The wind on the exposed ridge was pretty cold and soon we had to follow the path beaten in snow by previous&amp;nbsp;hikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Our dinner" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our dinner&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About one kilometer further, there was a nice flat top with amazing views of sharp mountains ahead as well as deep basin below. All covered in snow. Along the rocky ridge, we could see silhouettes of other hikes, hopefully, better equipped than us because peaks looked&amp;nbsp;icy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we descended back to the junction and finished the rest of the circuit along Paddy’s&amp;nbsp;Track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Still a fair bit to climb" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Still a fair bit to climb&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really tough part of the day, however, began after wed finished the track. With the sun going down by the hill, all the warmth disappeared and the temperature dropped considerably. Pinned to the gas stove, we warmed ourselves a bit while we were cooking dinner but in the open kitchen, we couldn’t stand for&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The first camping experience with temperatures way below zero" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first camping experience with temperatures way below zero&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the earliest bedtime ever but as our fluffy sleeping bags were the only place where we could survive, there was no other option then spent the rest of the evening like two snuggled&amp;nbsp;caterpillars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/11.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Day in Hobart Among Devils and Art" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eight days of travelling around Tasmania, we finished the loop back in Hobart. Here we had almost the entire day for some extra roaming before getting to the airport to catch a plane back&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Hobart from Mt Wellington" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Hobart from Mt Wellington&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our travel, we had seen quite a lot of wildlife but we hadn’t been lucky enough to spot a local iconic symbol - the Tasmanian devil. As we could not leave without seeing at least one, our first thing to do was a visit of &lt;a href="http://bonorong.com.au/"&gt;Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Face to face meeting with a kangaroo mate" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Face to face meeting with a kangaroo mate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People at Bonorong focus on rescue wildlife program and they work towards getting their animals back to the wild. A lot of animals got there after a collision with a car. The number of animals killed on the roads is huge what we actually could witness ourselves during our travel. We met heaps of carcasses along the roadsides and a few times we luckily managed to stop just before a collision with an&amp;nbsp;animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Yummy carrot with oats for breakfast" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Yummy carrot with oats for breakfast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we arrived early, there were only a few people around. At the entrance, we both got a small bag of granular kangaroo food and then carried on to the park. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat"&gt;wombats&lt;/a&gt; already ranked among our favourite animals but here they became even more adorable. One of them didn’t stop following its carer while the man was sweeping its pan. Three younger ones were munching their fresh breakfast. But when we saw two six-month-old hiding behind a carer’s legs and demanding for a rub - it was a peak of cuteness. It was hard to imagine that once the wombats turn about two years they become quite&amp;nbsp;aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Small cuddly wombats running around" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Small cuddly wombats running around&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a bit further, another carer was giving a talk to a group of Asians about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_devil"&gt;tasmanian devils&lt;/a&gt;. When we took our eyes off wombats and came closer to the group, two Tasmanian devils had been already poking their noses out of the den. After a while, they came out completely. In Bonorong, they are running a breeding program for those endangered&amp;nbsp;animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sniff, sniff, sniff" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sniff, sniff, sniff&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That morning we spent a bit of time among kangaroos which skipped around a large open area and from time to time they ate dry kangaroo food from visitors’ hands. The kangaroos were quite friendly and as we offered them the feed, they grabbed our hand in their paws and slowly crunched it. The kangaroo I fed was obviously hungry because when it finished the first handful of granules, it demanded more by pushing its muzzle to my&amp;nbsp;pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara feeding a joey" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara feeding a joey&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we left Bonorong Sanctuary, our next stop was at &lt;a href="http://www.wellingtonpark.org.au/"&gt;Mt Wellington&lt;/a&gt; where a lookout at the summit provided an awesome view of the city below and coastal area. The mountain was more than 1200m high and despite a nice autumn day, it was pretty cold on the top. So, instead of an initially planned walk, we just had a look from various platforms around the summit but then went back to the heated car.&amp;nbsp;Chickens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sheltered lookout on Mt Wellington" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sheltered lookout on Mt Wellington&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both like &lt;a href="http://gardens.rtbg.tas.gov.au/"&gt;botanical gardens&lt;/a&gt;. Those quiet places with a number of winding paths, glasshouses with humid air and generally because of their melancholic and kind of old-fashioned atmosphere. Therefore, whenever we visit a new town and there is enough time, we go at least for a short&amp;nbsp;stroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rock formation on top of the mountain" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rock formation on top of the mountain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this time, my winner section was an Oak Collection. The leaves on trees had already started to change their colors and they slowly passed from yellow into shades of orange and red. A few of them had fallen off and covered the grass. It was one of those nice days when you can smell autumn all around. The real autumn which we don’t have here in&amp;nbsp;Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Colours of Autumn" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Colours of Autumn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in the autumn sun we started to feel a bit cold after a while but still had a couple of hours. So, we decided to be cultural once in a while and visited one of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt;’s in Hobart - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MONA.&lt;/span&gt; The famous Tasmanian Museum of Old and New&amp;nbsp;Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Big pictures" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Big pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection included everything from an ancient mummy to obese swollen Ferrari. Some stuff was quite beyond our comprehension but a few pieces of installations were pretty cool. For instance, words formed from falling drops of water, a tunnel with special acoustics installation or words which could be read only with peripheral vision. Interesting was even building itself. The three-floor subterrane concrete colossus built into the side of a cliff with no windows was like a dark mysterious&amp;nbsp;labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An acoustic tunnel" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An acoustic tunnel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the creepiest thing about this place is that most museums offer a lifetime membership but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MONA&lt;/span&gt; goes beyond that. They offer &lt;a href="http://www.mona.net.au/mona/Cemetery"&gt;Eternity Membership&lt;/a&gt; – a membership that lasts even after your death. So, if you are really into art, you can enjoy it truly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jtpf8N5IDE"&gt;forever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wall covered with small pictures" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/13.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
