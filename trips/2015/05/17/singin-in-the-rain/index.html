      <p>In the middle of August, I came up with an idea that we could go to the theatre and watch a traditional show. Fortunately tickets for the American classic – musical <em>Singin’ in the Rain</em> – went to pre-sale for next year’s April, thus we bought the tickets with the hope that our visas will be sorted by then.</p>

<p>Time passed by like a river in Rivendell and April came and I was really excited and looked forward to the play and finally the day came.</p>

<p>After we arrived to the theatre, there had already been a lot of people standing in the lobby. The ceiling was covered with umbrellas of different sizes and colours. Umbrellas were everywhere! Not forgot to mention there is not much use for them in Wellington apart from ceiling decoration.</p>

<p>The theatre company who was going to perform that night was from <span class="caps">UK</span> and only a limited number of performances was available – the venue was sold out completely.</p>

<p>The theatre hall, which has two balconies and a few boxes, was stunning and pretty decorated. The dress code of the people around, on the other hand, not so much. We are used to go to the theatre quite well dressed as it’s considered to be a special social event, but that evening there weren’t many people dressed up. The most amazing guy wore a Wellington Huricanes’ jersey – pretty special dress for him I guess.</p>

<p>The play itself was amazing. The actors’ singing was brilliant and along with tap-dancing they performed an incredible show. The audience in the first four rows got raincoats because during the play it was actually really raining and there might have been a chance of a little splash. Apart form that the actors were kicking water all around them as well.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the musical to everybody who will have a chance to watch it. It was a wonderful evening full of joy and since then every time I say “Good morning!” at the office I heard this song in my head. So, good morning to all!</p>
