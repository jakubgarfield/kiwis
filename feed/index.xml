    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/11.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Day in Hobart Among Devils and Art" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eight days of travelling around Tasmania, we finished the loop back in Hobart. Here we had almost the entire day for some extra roaming before getting to the airport to catch a plane back&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Hobart from Mt Wellington" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Hobart from Mt Wellington&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our travel, we had seen quite a lot of wildlife but we hadn’t been lucky enough to spot a local iconic symbol - the Tasmanian devil. As we could not leave without seeing at least one, our first thing to do was a visit of &lt;a href="http://bonorong.com.au/"&gt;Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Face to face meeting with a kangaroo mate" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Face to face meeting with a kangaroo mate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People at Bonorong focus on rescue wildlife program and they work towards getting their animals back to the wild. A lot of animals got there after a collision with a car. The number of animals killed on the roads is huge what we actually could witness ourselves during our travel. We met heaps of carcasses along the roadsides and a few times we luckily managed to stop just before a collision with an&amp;nbsp;animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Yummy carrot with oats for breakfast" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Yummy carrot with oats for breakfast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we arrived early, there were only a few people around. At the entrance, we both got a small bag of granular kangaroo food and then carried on to the park. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat"&gt;wombats&lt;/a&gt; already ranked among our favourite animals but here they became even more adorable. One of them didn’t stop following its carer while the man was sweeping its pan. Three younger ones were munching their fresh breakfast. But when we saw two six-month-old hiding behind a carer’s legs and demanding for a rub - it was a peak of cuteness. It was hard to imagine that once the wombats turn about two years they become quite&amp;nbsp;aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Small cuddly wombats running around" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Small cuddly wombats running around&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a bit further, another carer was giving a talk to a group of Asians about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_devil"&gt;tasmanian devils&lt;/a&gt;. When we took our eyes off wombats and came closer to the group, two Tasmanian devils had been already poking their noses out of the den. After a while, they came out completely. In Bonorong, they are running a breeding program for those endangered&amp;nbsp;animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sniff, sniff, sniff" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sniff, sniff, sniff&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That morning we spent a bit of time among kangaroos which skipped around a large open area and from time to time they ate dry kangaroo food from visitors’ hands. The kangaroos were quite friendly and as we offered them the feed, they grabbed our hand in their paws and slowly crunched it. The kangaroo I fed was obviously hungry because when it finished the first handful of granules, it demanded more by pushing its muzzle to my&amp;nbsp;pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara feeding a joey" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara feeding a joey&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we left Bonorong Sanctuary, our next stop was at &lt;a href="http://www.wellingtonpark.org.au/"&gt;Mt Wellington&lt;/a&gt; where a lookout at the summit provided an awesome view of the city below and coastal area. The mountain was more than 1200m high and despite a nice autumn day, it was pretty cold on the top. So, instead of an initially planned walk, we just had a look from various platforms around the summit but then went back to the heated car.&amp;nbsp;Chickens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sheltered lookout on Mt Wellington" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sheltered lookout on Mt Wellington&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both like &lt;a href="http://gardens.rtbg.tas.gov.au/"&gt;botanical gardens&lt;/a&gt;. Those quiet places with a number of winding paths, glasshouses with humid air and generally because of their melancholic and kind of old-fashioned atmosphere. Therefore, whenever we visit a new town and there is enough time, we go at least for a short&amp;nbsp;stroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rock formation on top of the mountain" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rock formation on top of the mountain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this time, my winner section was an Oak Collection. The leaves on trees had already started to change their colors and they slowly passed from yellow into shades of orange and red. A few of them had fallen off and covered the grass. It was one of those nice days when you can smell autumn all around. The real autumn which we don’t have here in&amp;nbsp;Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Colours of Autumn" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Colours of Autumn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in the autumn sun we started to feel a bit cold after a while but still had a couple of hours. So, we decided to be cultural once in a while and visited one of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt;’s in Hobart - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MONA.&lt;/span&gt; The famous Tasmanian Museum of Old and New&amp;nbsp;Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Big pictures" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Big pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection included everything from an ancient mummy to obese swollen Ferrari. Some stuff was quite beyond our comprehension but a few pieces of installations were pretty cool. For instance, words formed from falling drops of water, a tunnel with special acoustics installation or words which could be read only with peripheral vision. Interesting was even building itself. The three-floor subterrane concrete colossus built into the side of a cliff with no windows was like a dark mysterious&amp;nbsp;labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An acoustic tunnel" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An acoustic tunnel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the creepiest thing about this place is that most museums offer a lifetime membership but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MONA&lt;/span&gt; goes beyond that. They offer &lt;a href="http://www.mona.net.au/mona/Cemetery"&gt;Eternity Membership&lt;/a&gt; – a membership that lasts even after your death. So, if you are really into art, you can enjoy it truly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jtpf8N5IDE"&gt;forever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wall covered with small pictures" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/13.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/8.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Two Capes and Tasman Peninsula" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/06/07/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/"&gt;Freycinet Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, we carried on down to the south to Tasman Peninsula where we were going to stay following two&amp;nbsp;nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The winding path to Cape Hauy" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The winding path to Cape Hauy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we turned off the main road to our campsite at Fortescue Bay, the road more resembled a tank training area than anything else. After 45 minutes slalom drive, we finally reached the campsite. It was a really, basic, but nice area in the forest and a few meters from the beach. Much to Jakub’s delight, each campsite had a small campfire ring. So, we spent the rest of the afternoon looking for brushwood and leftover firewood near other campsites. Much to my&amp;nbsp;delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The campfire is set up -- let’s make dinner!" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The campfire is set up &amp;#8211; let’s make dinner!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we planned the track to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1533"&gt;Cape Hauy&lt;/a&gt;. The first part of the track was identical with the &lt;a href="http://www.threecapestrack.com.au/index.html"&gt;Three Capes Track&lt;/a&gt; which is a quite recently opened multi-day hike.  Unfortunately, as we didn’t have time to do the whole 3-4 day track, we had to be happy only with a little tasting of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The finish of Three Capes Track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The finish of Three Capes Track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part of the track which passed through woodland was quite easy and nothing unexpected happened. Except the thing that I almost stepped on a small &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-lipped_snake"&gt;white-lipped snake&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, as we found out on info table when we came to our campsite, it wasn’t very dangerous&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The rock formation of Cape Hauy" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The rock formation of Cape Hauy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we passed the trail junction, left heading to the Three Capes Track, we carried on towards the cape and suddenly, the great views of steep cliffs and rock formations appeared. On the top of the headland, there was a small lookout platform. Even with its safety bars I shortly hesitated to come closer to the edge. I can’t help myself but I always have to think about the worse things which might happen at places like this. No matter how unrealistic my visions are. Obviously, it was no issue for people who had chosen two huge poles sticking out of the sea for their climbing&amp;nbsp;target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The thrilling view from the lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The thrilling view from the lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the track, we spent the rest of the afternoon exploring the near surrounding and had a look at Tasmans Arch,  Devils Kitchen or Tasman Blowholes. All of those are easily accessible spots with some nice&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The panoramic views stretched far south" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The panoramic views stretched far south&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we stopped at Port Arthur, a tiny town recommended by travel book, to find out that nothing interesting was there. Unless you were a fan of &lt;a href="http://portarthur.org.au/"&gt;historic convict sites&lt;/a&gt; or wanted to take one of ghost tours which we did not. On the other hand, a few more kilometers far away, there was a place called Remarkable Cave, which was definitely worth the&amp;nbsp;drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The light at the end of the tunnel of Remarkable Cave" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The light at the end of the tunnel of Remarkable Cave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived back to the campsite, we &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt; have spent the last few moments of daylight collecting the firewood. I have to admit that it was fantastic sitting at the fire later in the cold night sipping the tea and enjoying the heat. It didn’t take long and a couple of possums came closer as well. They probably hoped for something to eat but with our minimum supplies we had, we couldn’t afford any losses. They should have rather visited one of the resorts which our neighbours built up around. It was incredible what some people brought for a single weekend or even one&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Just keep the safe distance from the edge" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Just keep the safe distance from the edge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, the walk to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1536"&gt;Cape Raoul&lt;/a&gt; had been on the list before we headed off back to Hobart. The weather wasn’t really pleasant and the moment we stepped out from the forest on the open rock plateau covered only with shrub, we were almost blown away by strong wind. Walk along the edge provided heaps of stunning views and in the deep beneath us, we also noticed a small colony of seals. Their sharp barking was hearable even in the strong&amp;nbsp;wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The shrub is bent by some of the strongest recorded winds in Australia" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The shrub is bent by some of the strongest recorded winds in Australia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we just one more time enjoyed the view of amazing cliffs and swirling sea from a small clearing before we plunged into woodland and hurried up back to the car park because there were still a few hours of driving ahead of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The was a seal colony somewhere in the deep" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The was a seal colony somewhere in the deep&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with the walk to Cape Raoul, we wrapped up our exploring of Tasman Peninsula and actually the exploring of the whole Tasmanian nature as well. In the evening, we were going to be back in a big city and there was some exciting stuff planned for our last&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Apart from the strong winds, this place lacked fresh water as well." src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Apart from the strong winds, this place lacked fresh water as well.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/3.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; golden beaches of Freycinet Peninsula" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning we left Cradle Mountain, the weather wasn’t really nice and therefore our transfer to Freycinet Peninsula was more like a road trip instead of undertaking any longer&amp;nbsp;tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way, we made a short turn-off to Mount Claude Lookout. Just before we approached the top of the hill, a little animal was crossing the road. It was an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna"&gt;echidna&lt;/a&gt;. Something between a hedgehog and a porcupine (but only at first sign). It safely crossed the road and carried on sniffling around with it’s tiny muzzle, probably looking for some juicy&amp;nbsp;ants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A spiky little creature in pursuit of a lunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to the east coast, we made only a few short stops – for lunch, to buy a bottle of a local wine and to have a look over surrounding vineyards and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting_Lagoon_Important_Bird_Area"&gt;Moulting Lagoon&lt;/a&gt; from lookout next to Cherry Tree&amp;nbsp;Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of wineries and Moulting Lagoon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we arrived to Coles Bay where we were going to stay over the night, we stretched our legs a little bit during a short walk on &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1450"&gt;Friendly Beaches&lt;/a&gt;. With sunny weather it must be a beautiful beach with its white sand and it probably has some good waves for surfing too. Unfortunately, when we got there, it started to rain and with cloudy sky everything looked a bit dull. But so what, we are not made of&amp;nbsp;sugar…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of a rocky beach" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of a rocky beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pitching our tent at Coles Bay campground, there was still some time to go and have a look at &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1462"&gt;Cape Tourville Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; which was about 15 minute drive from the camp. An easy circuit allows for stupendous views of coastal cliffs and infinite blueness Tasman&amp;nbsp;Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A lighthouse. Bara likes it. Jakub finds it as every other lighthouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we made one last turn-off which followed the Sleepy Bay track down to the beach (there was nothing exciting), but then we drove back to the campsite as it was slowly getting&amp;nbsp;dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An orange Sleepy Bay in the background" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An orange Sleepy Bay in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning, we needed to change a climb to Mt Amos for &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1478"&gt;Hazards Beach Circuit&lt;/a&gt; as it’d been raining for the last few days and we were informed that it’s not safe to undertake the track because of slippery boulders. After the similar experience we’d had in &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/05/17/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/"&gt;Cradle Mountains&lt;/a&gt; we agreed to take the alternative&amp;nbsp;walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track to Mt Amos was closed as it was too slippery" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The track to Mt Amos was closed as it was too slippery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first the part of the track which was a bit crowded even when we started early in the morning. But most of the people reached the Wineglass Bay Lookout and turned back, so as we went down from the lookout to the beach, we barely met anybody. There we sat for a couple of minutes and watched waves rushing to the shore and crashing against white sand&amp;nbsp;beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wineglass Bay Lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Wineglass Bay Lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track then continued further through low-lying marshy area to the Hazards Beach. Except one or two wallabies, we didn’t meet anybody there. On the beach, there were heaps of Paua and other shells washed out and as we walked along, we made a little&amp;nbsp;collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Golden sands of Hazard Beach" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Golden sands of Hazard Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section of the circuit provided some good views of the Great Oyster Bay and also of rocky peaks of The Hazards. Before we got back to the carpark we spotted another curious wallaby and one really, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REALLY&lt;/span&gt; ugly spider. That was exactly why we shook out our shoes every day in the morning. Just in&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara's collection of shells" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara&amp;#8217;s collection of shells&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way from the Freycinet National Park we stopped at a little oyster market where they also served freshly made seafood and fish meals. Jakub tried his fabled lobster which eventually turned out to be not fabled at all. So, he was a bit disappointed but my garlic salmon was&amp;nbsp;delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The not so delicious dreamed of lobster" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The not so delicious dreamed of lobster&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was time to carry on to the south towards our last destination - Tasman&amp;nbsp;Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/6.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Cradle Mountain Summit" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We woke up to the chilly but sunny morning in Cradle Mountain where we were going to stay for the next two days. The &lt;a href="https://www.discoveryholidayparks.com.au/tas/cradle_mountain/cradle_mountain"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; we’d booked had a convenient location close to a bunch of tracks and a really nice&amp;nbsp;setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="That’s where we started -- on the other side of Dove Lake" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;That’s where we started &amp;#8211; on the other side of Dove Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just on the way to the camp kitchen, we met a couple of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaby"&gt;wallabies&lt;/a&gt; wandering around tents. The kitchen had a big fireplace which kept the whole room nice and cosy even when the temperature outside were only slightly above zero&amp;nbsp;degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick breakfast, we jumped into the car and drove to Lake Dove where we’d planned to spend a day on&amp;nbsp;hiking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The goal for today -- the Cradle Mountain Summit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The goal for today &amp;#8211; the Cradle Mountain Summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite early in the morning, but the car park next to Dove Lake was packed with tourist. There was a large group of Germans getting ready to set off the track and heaps of Asians taking pictures of everything around. But one could not wonder because the morning panorama of the rocky mountains behind the blue lake was&amp;nbsp;stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The morning cloud covering the Cradle Mountain" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The morning cloud covering the Cradle Mountain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shortly looked around as well but then set off towards Lake Lila. As most people chose a shorter walk around Lake Dove, we managed to avoid the biggest crowd. We followed the path up to Wombat Pool, passed Wombat Peak and also spotted a few wombats’ poos. A wombat is obviously a big thing&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chilling on a bench at Wombat Pool" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Chilling on a bench at Wombat Pool&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were clambering to the Marions Lookout, we overtook a few people with huge backpacks who were undertaking the &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=7771"&gt;Overland Track&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to do the entire 6-day walk, and therefore we chose the &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1362"&gt;Summit Track&lt;/a&gt; to walk at least a little bit of it. And without the additional 20 kg on our backs it was much nicer&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An amazing blue colour of Crater Lake" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An amazing blue colour of Crater Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climb to Marions Lookout was definitely worth the effort. During a refreshing break we were enjoying the amazing views of surroundings – deep blue lakes beneath us, jagged mountains behind&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view from Marions Lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view from Marions Lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there to Kitchen’s Hut, the walk across the Cradle Plateau was flat and easy, but then it started to ascend and ended up almost as a 300 m vertical climb.  Roughly in the middle of the slope, the beaten path disappeared and the crawling across big rocks followed. About 80 m below the summit, my fear of heights won and I decided to wait for Jakub as he tried to reach the summit. However, even he gave up and came back after a while because the boulders were quite slippery due to rain from the previous night. Nevertheless, the views of the landscape were still&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Still on the beaten path but not for too long" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Still on the beaten path but not for too long&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we steeply descended to Lake Wilks and further to the shore of Lake Dove where we connected to the wooden path of &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1318"&gt;Dove Lake Circuit&lt;/a&gt;. The path ran through a tranquil area known as The Ballroom Forest with ancient myrtles and&amp;nbsp;beeches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A maize from roots while walking through the forest" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A maize from roots while walking through the forest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit further, we suddenly heard a crackling noise in the bush. After a few minutes of listening and trying to identify that thing, we saw a grey fur. And then a nose. &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/04/27/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/"&gt;Another wombat&lt;/a&gt; on lunch&amp;nbsp;expedition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A jagged summit of Cradle Mountain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the easier Dove Lake Circuit, this section of the track was quite busy. When we reached the Boat Shed, it was literally overcrowded. It was almost impossible to take a picture which wouldn’t include a tourist on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A rare short moment without tourists at Boat Shed" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A rare short moment without tourists at Boat Shed&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to our campsite, we were lucky one more time when a little furry walked across the road. Fortunately, we were driving slowly enough because it stopped right in the middle, casually rubbed its butt and then carried on in the pursuit of some tasty&amp;nbsp;grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Enchanted walk along the edges of Pencil Pine Creek" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Enchanted walk along the edges of Pencil Pine Creek&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up the day with a short &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1359"&gt;Enchanted walk&lt;/a&gt; along a creek through an old rainforest but then continued to our camp for dinner. And that was it for our time in Cradle Mountains because the next day we were slowly moving to the coast of &lt;a href="http://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/national-parks-and-wilderness/freycinet-national-park-wineglass-bay"&gt;Freycinet Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/6.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; on the way to Cradle Mountains" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning at Lake St Clair was cold and cloudy. It was the first time when we’d really appreciated our warm sleeping bags because until then we’d always woken up sweating almost every time we’d used&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snuggling in the chilly morning at Lake St Clair" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Snuggling in the chilly morning at Lake St Clair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial intention of taking photos of sunrise above the lake had to be replaced by taking mysterious photos with the fog rolling above the water surface. After a few attempts, which ended up with a long black blur because Jakub didn’t run and climb quickly enough on a big boulder, we finally managed to take a shot of the two of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view from King William Saddle" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view from King William Saddle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to our tent, we found a proper camp kitchen with all equipment and a fireplace. It was a nice change after cooking in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBQ&lt;/span&gt; shelter the night before because we’d thought, by mistake, that it had been the only kitchen there. An Australian friendly older couple kept us company for breakfast. They were quite excited about our &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/04/13/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/"&gt;snake adventure&lt;/a&gt; from the previous day and the guy also told us how many time he’d been bitten by a snake just during last&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then it was time to set&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An emerald valley from Donaghys Lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An emerald valley from Donaghys Lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we reached the King William Saddle, the clouds had got melted and the sun had come out. We made our first little stop at &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1561"&gt;Franklin River&lt;/a&gt;, where there was an easy 25 minutes nature trail. The walk ran along the wild river and through the cool temperate rainforest. It was nice for stretching our legs but, otherwise, nothing really&amp;nbsp;special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Iconic Frenchmans Cap" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Iconic Frenchmans Cap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further along the road, there was another short walk which climbed up to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1564"&gt;Donaghys Lookout&lt;/a&gt;. This walk was a more satisfying one as from the top it offered a great view of skyline with peaky mountains and a wide emerald valley spread down below&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Munching through the sandwich at the Nelson Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Munching through the sandwich at the Nelson Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thirds short walk was one to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1568"&gt;Nelson Falls&lt;/a&gt;. Again, it was an easy but really nice stretch through the forest when we walked along a little stream before we ended up in front of the waterfall. That time, there wasn’t much water running in the stream but still it was a cool little&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A mine near Queenstown" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A mine near Queenstown&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, when we arrived at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queenstown,_Tasmania"&gt;Queenstown&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to stop and refill our supplies because it looked like the last bigger town on the way to our campsite. Obviously, a reasonable amount of money has been invested in keeping the little old mining town attractive but to us, it looked more creepy and actually quite sad. We dropped the idea to stay for coffee and rather carried on. But it should be noted that the local shop was well&amp;nbsp;supplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chilling under the height of Montezuma Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Chilling under the height of Montezuma Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last stop of the day before heading off straight to our campsite were &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1374"&gt;Montezuma Falls&lt;/a&gt;. As we were a bit running out of time, we set a fast pace along the historic tramway and reached the waterfall in less than one hour. Just before the falls, there was an old little tunnel in the rock. And we had a torch! For those who don’t like spider webs and spiders, it’s better to go without it. At least, you don’t see them and the tunnel was blocked up after a few meters&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The feared swing bridge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare to Nelson, the Montezuma falls were narrow and high — 104m. Immediately below the falls, there was a swing bridge over the creek. It reminded me how a bad head for heights I have. So, I rather waited on the bank while Jakub was exploring the other&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our new mate, Rusty, sniffing in the meadows&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Montezuma Falls, we carried on to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3297"&gt;Cradle Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The weather was getting worse and we were worried about putting our tent together in the rain. We were about approaching the campsite when we met a highlight of the day. A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat"&gt;wombat&lt;/a&gt;! It was just standing next to the road, noshing the grass and absolutely didn’t bother when Jakub was taking a picture of it. The 40 kg of cuteness at the end of the day.&amp;nbsp;Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/04/13/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/5.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Lake St Clair and tiger snake" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coming back from Christmas holiday, we were looking for a destination which we would explore during Easter. We had a really great time in &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/04/26/blue-mountains/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; last year and eventually we decided to go back to the region. But this time, we planned to visit the Apple Island –&amp;nbsp;Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Some parts of the track were easy, the others were not" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Some parts of the track were easy, the others were not&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite our colleagues comments “What are you going to do there? There is nothing.” we were convinced that it’s an exciting place with the nice nature and wildlife. Moreover, we still had vouchers from Jetstar as a compensation for delayed flight from &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/11/22/bali-from-temple-to-waterfall-and-rice-fields/"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; last October. With a bit of “luck”, we might get some more this time&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of many little clearings on the way back to Cynthia Bay" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of many little clearings on the way back to Cynthia Bay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After arrival to Hobart, we picked up our little &lt;a href="https://www.thrifty.com.au/"&gt;rental Kia&lt;/a&gt; and drove to a &lt;a href="http://www.barilla.com.au/"&gt;booked campsite&lt;/a&gt; located conveniently near the airport. As we recently bought a new tent, this was our first big camping trip because, before, we only tested it during our weekend trips like the &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/24/queen-charlotte-track/"&gt;Queen Charlotte track&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="If you fancy a burger, The Standard is a good choice" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;If you fancy a burger, The Standard is a good choice&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we built the tent on our artificial grass spot, we went for a stroll around the evening city. While looking for a place to have dinner, we came across a hidden burger stand – &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/standardburgers"&gt;The Standard&lt;/a&gt;. A simple stage was provided for seating and we ate our yummy burger under a ceiling covered by lampions. The evening was wrapped up with a chilled drink at another random tiny&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An interesting ceiling at The Standard" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An interesting ceiling at The Standard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to our campsite, we met the wildlife for the first time - two wallabies sitting in the middle of the road. Luckily, we drove slowly enough and they managed to skip safely&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning, we left cloudy Hobart behind and headed off to Lake St Clair. On the way, we enjoyed the surrounded landscape covered by the sunshine. We could smell the autumn in the air. As we were a bit in a rush to catch a ferry across the lake, we didn’t really had a chance to make any big stops, except the one for coffee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; cheesecake in &lt;a href="http://www.hamiltonheritageholidayhomes.com.au/"&gt;Jackson’s Emporium&lt;/a&gt; in Hamilton. The place looked a bit shabby from outside, but an interior was really&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A coffee break at Jackson’s Emporium" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A coffee break at Jackson’s Emporium&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Lake St Clair just on time to buy a &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=914"&gt;National Park pass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lakestclairlodge.com.au/about-lake-st-clair/lake-st-clair-ferry/"&gt;ferry tickets&lt;/a&gt; and then we rushed to the jetty where a boat was already&amp;nbsp;waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Mt Olympus " src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Mt Olympus &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a 15 minutes sail, we had a great view of surrounding peaks before we got off at Narcissus Bay and set off for about a 17 km long way back to Cynthia&amp;nbsp;Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Wellington, before our holiday, Jakub had done a research in Tasmanian dangerous animals and what kind of equipment might be needed. Gaiters had been one of the optional recommendations as a protection against snake bite, but eventually, we hadn’t bought any. And so it happened that within first fifteen minutes, as we walked through sunny open woodlands, we met a &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=4750"&gt;tiger snake&lt;/a&gt;. It was lying in the sunshine right next to the path. Luckily, it slithered away and left us only in a little shock. After that experience, we spent most of the time staring at the ground to avoid any other&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A sunset at Lake St Clair" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A sunset at Lake St Clair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, when we walked into the rainforest, the path winded among trees and sometimes it was even hard to follow it in a maze of roots. At Echo Point, we made a short break but then carried on because there were still 10 km&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A quick break at Echo Point jetty" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A quick break at Echo Point jetty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were approaching to Cynthia Bay, the sun getting closer to the horizon and the dense rainforest was getting darker. We could smell tea tree in the air. Suddenly, we heard a noise in the bush. After a while of staring at shrubs, we saw there a little wallaby hiding and eating some grass but as soon as it mentioned us, it quickly jumped&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Our shiny, kind of new, portable hotel" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our shiny, kind of new, portable hotel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the track within about 5 hours and reached the &lt;a href="https://www.lakestclairpark.com.au/"&gt;campsite&lt;/a&gt; right on time to manage to build our tent with the rest of daylight. After tasty dinner and with kilometers in our legs, we were already in our cosy sleeping bags when we heard our neighbours grumbling about the mess a possum made around their camping spot while they were doing the&amp;nbsp;dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cold misty morning at Lake St Clair" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cold misty morning at Lake St Clair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, we quickly felt asleep because there were other exciting journeys waiting for the next&amp;nbsp;day!&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/04/05/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/8.jpg" alt="Day hike to Mt McKerrow summit" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since we did &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/rimutaka-forest-park/things-to-do/tracks/mt-mckerrow/"&gt;Mt McKerrow track&lt;/a&gt;, but now it would be shame to keep this track just to ourselves as it is conveniently close to Wellington and it’s perfect for a shorter day&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The path to the Mt McKerrow summit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The path to the Mt McKerrow summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climb to Mt Mckerrow starts from Catchpool Valley or Wainuiomata. As we’d already done that part of the track from Catchpool Valley side before, we decided to leave our car in Wainuiomata and start the track from&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="We started somewhere down there" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;We started somewhere down there&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather wasn’t really impressive that day with a typical &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/15/where-world-windiest-city-spoiler-alert-chicago-wellington"&gt;Wellingtonian gale&lt;/a&gt;, so we appreciated the track path ran through the forest which protected us from being blown away. On the other hand, it prevented from any good&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lost in the deep forest" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lost in the deep forest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the track was quite steep, but once we reached the top of the hill and walked along the ridge, the only difficulty was roots and a bit of mud. Moreover, if there was no sign – an iron pole – we would miss the Mt McKerrow summit at&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rimutaka Range in the background" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rimutaka Range in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, where trees became sparse, there were some good views of &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2014/08/31/east-harbour-regional-park/"&gt;Wellington Harbour and East Regional Park&lt;/a&gt; on one side and Rimutaka Range on the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fifty shades of green" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fifty shades of green&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we decided to turn down to the Boys Brigade camp to avoid returning along the same path to the car-park. However, the track was a bit rough and not really comfortable, especially when it connected to a slippery &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4WD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One more view towards Wainuiomata and Hutt Valley" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/day-hike-to-mt-mckerrow-summit/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One more view towards Wainuiomata and Hutt Valley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the track within about 5 hours, including a short wrong turn-off, which made it a nice Saturday afternoon walk. Just next time, we definitely need more water as during that initial climb you get quite&amp;nbsp;sweaty.&lt;/p&gt;
