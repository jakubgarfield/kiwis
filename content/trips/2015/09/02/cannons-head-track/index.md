The Sunday morning surprised us with unexpected sunshine. The weather forecast had changed again and instead of day in lounge we started planning another last minute trip.

While we were looking for a suitable track our morning was livened up by broken washing machine which stopped working in the middle of washing and we had to pull all the socks out with bbq tongs.

With the feeling we’d already used up all the bad luck for that day we set off towards Cannons Creek Lake Reserve where we’d planned to climb up to Cannons Head which promised nice views of Porirua Harbour and maybe even South Island.

The beginning of the track was easy as it followed the Cannons Creek. The clouds above us were creating an interesting composition of lights and shades on hill slopes surrounding us and a whole picture was completed by white sheep dots.

As the track started to ascend, the path was more slippery because of recent rainfalls. By the time we reached Takapu Road our shoes and trousers were pretty muddy. But never mind, they will wash themselves in wet grass later on.

With the view of Cannons Head ahead we continued along the path until...we ran across a closed gate with a big notice: CLOSED FOR LAMBING!!! In a minute, a half-day track became quite a short walk.

A bit disappointed we turned back and walked to the car park as we didn’t find any alternative way to finish the track. But we’re planning to try it again. At least now we know that next time we can park at the end of Takapu Road and won’t have to walk the same part twice. Moreover, hopefully, there will be heaps of cute little lambs next time.
