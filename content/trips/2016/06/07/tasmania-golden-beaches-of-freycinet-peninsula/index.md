The morning we left Cradle Mountain, the weather wasn’t really nice and therefore our transfer to Freycinet Peninsula was more like a road trip instead of undertaking any longer tracks.

On the way, we made a short turn-off to Mount Claude Lookout. Just before we approached the top of the hill, a little animal was crossing the road. It was an [echidna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna). Something between a hedgehog and a porcupine (but only at first sign). It safely crossed the road and carried on sniffling around with it’s tiny muzzle, probably looking for some juicy ants.

On the way to the east coast, we made only a few short stops -- for lunch, to buy a bottle of a local wine and to have a look over surrounding vineyards and the [Moulting Lagoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting_Lagoon_Important_Bird_Area) from lookout next to Cherry Tree Hill.

Before we arrived to Coles Bay where we were going to stay over the night, we stretched our legs a little bit during a short walk on [Friendly Beaches](http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1450). With sunny weather it must be a beautiful beach with its white sand and it probably has some good waves for surfing too. Unfortunately, when we got there, it started to rain and with cloudy sky everything looked a bit dull. But so what, we are not made of sugar…

After pitching our tent at Coles Bay campground, there was still some time to go and have a look at [Cape Tourville Lighthouse](http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1462) which was about 15 minute drive from the camp. An easy circuit allows for stupendous views of coastal cliffs and infinite blueness Tasman Sea.

On the way back, we made one last turn-off which followed the Sleepy Bay track down to the beach (there was nothing exciting), but then we drove back to the campsite as it was slowly getting dark.

The next day morning, we needed to change a climb to Mt Amos for [Hazards Beach Circuit](http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1478) as it’d been raining for the last few days and we were informed that it’s not safe to undertake the track because of slippery boulders. After the similar experience we’d had in [Cradle Mountains](https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/05/17/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/) we agreed to take the alternative walk.

It was the first the part of the track which was a bit crowded even when we started early in the morning. But most of the people reached the Wineglass Bay Lookout and turned back, so as we went down from the lookout to the beach, we barely met anybody. There we sat for a couple of minutes and watched waves rushing to the shore and crashing against white sand beach.

The track then continued further through low-lying marshy area to the Hazards Beach. Except one or two wallabies, we didn’t meet anybody there. On the beach, there were heaps of Paua and other shells washed out and as we walked along, we made a little collection.

The last section of the circuit provided some good views of the Great Oyster Bay and also of rocky peaks of The Hazards. Before we got back to the carpark we spotted another curious wallaby and one really, REALLY ugly spider. That was exactly why we shook out our shoes every day in the morning. Just in case.

On the way from the Freycinet National Park we stopped at a little oyster market where they also served freshly made seafood and fish meals. Jakub tried his fabled lobster which eventually turned out to be not fabled at all. So, he was a bit disappointed but my garlic salmon was delicious.

Then it was time to carry on to the south towards our last destination - Tasman Peninsula.
