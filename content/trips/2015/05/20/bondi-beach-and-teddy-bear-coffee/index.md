The last day in Sydney we decided to devote to a walk along the coast line. Sydney offers a wide selection of various city walks and we'd chosen the one that started at Bondi Beach and followed the coast line to Coogee Beach.

But first things first, we had to have breakfast. There was one place which we had passed every day of our stay and which looked great but we hadn't had a chance to try it.

We arrived during their happy hour when they offered a breakfast menu for quite a good price and I had been looking forward to the unique coffee with a "teddy bear" on top for the whole four days. A bit shocking was the moment when Jakub ordered a Belgian waffle which were lying covered by glass top in front of him and a waitress asked for the price of 14 AUD. For one plain waffle???

How surprised we were when the waitress came with a dessert as big as a main meal. Two waffles covered by heap of strawberries and bananas smothered in chocolate sauce and next to that there were  two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. No wonder we had to sit in the caf√© for another half an hour after Jakub had finished it and experienced a sugar heart attack.

When we finally got to Bondi beach it was almost midday. The weather was beautiful and even though it was a work day the beach was full of people enjoying the sun.

The walk from Bondi to Coogee beach was supposed to take about 3 hours and a path wound along the coastline with great view of the ocean and adjacent cliffs. During the walk we passed a few nice small beaches. At one of them we watched a beautiful couple of colourful parrots. They might have belonged to someone but they flew over the beaches and tried to set up a nest on top of a few heads of curious tourists -- unsuccessfully though.

We finished our walk just on time before a quick shower blew up but as soon as we got back to the city centre the sky was clear again.

After our last lunch there we rushed back to our accommodation to pack all our stuff because later in the afternoon we had to catch a plane to Cairns.
