      <p>Blue Mountains were on the list for day two. On purpose, we chose Sunday for this trip because there is an extra cheap public transport fee on that day. Thus, instead of hiring a car we decided to go there on train. It was a good idea to catch an earlier train as a lot of people had the same plan as we had.</p>

<p>The journey was passing through the landscape and finally after two hours we got off the train in Wentworth Falls, a small town where we started the National Pass walk. This amazing walk runs through the forest and a part of it was carved out into the sandstone rocks. The lookouts along the walk enable the magical views of the forest which is spreading far to the horizon and is surrounded by exposed cliffs. Eventually, the rainy weather from the previous day was beneficial.</p>

<p>Everywhere around us water was dropping from walls and more than once we had to walk through small waterfalls. The forest’s air was fresh and full of yelling sounds of white parrots sitting in treetops. Later on we came to Wentworth Falls, spectacular falls with another magnificent view, which were an ideal place for lunch break.</p>

<p>Back in the town we decided to take a bus and go to see Three Sisters, a recommended must-to-do in this location. Unfortunately, there was a million other people who must have done the same thing as we did and so the lookout was overcrowded by furious tourists. The horror way back to the town on bus which seemed to explode was the icing on the cake. We were really relieved when we got off alive.</p>

<p>In the evening, back in Sydney we finished the adventurous day with the visit of Chinatown and had dinner in one of many busy restaurants. This time we tried Chinese dumplings - the small balls filled with minced meat. An interesting tasty meal, but service wasn’t really good as they forgot to bring a half of our order. Hopefully, we will be more successful in our next choice.</p>
