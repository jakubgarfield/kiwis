<p>When we opened the curtain in our little room the sky was blue. Finally, that was what we were waiting for. An ideal day for visiting Taronga Zoo — a recommended place where you can see all kind of Australian native animals and as it is located on hillside it has a wonderful view of Sydney harbour too.</p>

  <figcaption>We had a light breakfast with a view of Darling Harbour Bridge</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With a little stop to buy something for breakfast, we head off to Darling Harbour to catch a ferry to the Zoo. The warning signal number one: there was quite a lot of people heading the same way.</p>

<p>After we got off in our final destination, there was an enormous queue of people waiting for a cable car which took you to the beginning of the zoo walk. A woman who organized all that mess navigated us to the bus which took as up to the hill to the front gate as we didn’t have our tickets. The warning signal number two: a lot of kids all around.</p>

  <figcaption>Koala is the Zen master</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since we had a strategic place close to the door on bus we were able to get to the box office before that whole crowd of people. With the feeling of victory and with a map in hands we were ready to start our adventure when a woman at Info service put us wise to an extra seal performance because of today’s <span class="caps">SCHOOL</span> <span class="caps">HOLIDAY.</span> We were probably at the place where the kids density per meter squared was the highest in whole Sydney. Kids were everywhere!</p>

<figure>
  <a href="/photos/960x/taronga-zoo-and-rooftop-bar/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"><img alt="The devil himself" src="/photos/640x/taronga-zoo-and-rooftop-bar/4.jpg" height="427" width="640"></a>

</figure>

<p>However, the zoo itself was really nice and we had a chance to see a lot of animals that are not common in European zoos like koala, wombat, Tasmanian devil, platypus or wallaby. And we could enjoy that great view of harbour.</p>

</figure>

<p>Obviously, the seal show was hot goods there because the people were lining up as a giant snake along the path and so we decided to give up immediately. Instead of that we continued with our wall towards the down terminal of cable car and took a round trip as we missed it in the morning.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="/photos/960x/taronga-zoo-and-rooftop-bar/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"><img alt="Restaurants were getting ready for dinner time" src="/photos/640x/taronga-zoo-and-rooftop-bar/6.jpg" height="427" width="640"></a>
  <figcaption>Restaurants were getting ready for dinner time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Later in the afternoon, back in the city, we started to look for a place where we could have a lunch and dinner at once. We had a fancy for Indian cuisine but, suddenly, there were no Indian restaurants around. Duly starving, we finally found one which we were satisfied with, even if it was Nepali one. It was a good choice this time, because the meal was delicious!</p>

<p>After a little rest at our room we were fresh again for our evening plan which was visiting a Sydney’s bar. It was our last evening so we weren’t modest. We wanted something special.</p>

<p>A rooftop bar!</p>

<p>However, it wasn’t so easy as it sounds. Surprisingly, most of bars are in ground floors or in the middle of built-up areas with no views. Some of them were simply out of our budget and when we googled something promising it was <span class="caps">CLOSED</span>!</p>

<figure>
  <a href="/photos/960x/taronga-zoo-and-rooftop-bar/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"><img alt="We enjoyed a nice glass of wine with view of Sydney opera" src="/photos/640x/taronga-zoo-and-rooftop-bar/8.jpg" height="427" width="640"></a>
  <figcaption>We enjoyed a nice glass of wine with view of Sydney opera</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, after a couple of hours and walking criss-cross the city we ended up in the Glenmore bar in the Rocks. We should have probably gone there straight from the beginning because it was exactly what we’d wanted. The bar seemed to be nothing really special from the street but the rooftop part was amazing with its view of night harbour and the Opera House. Along with tasty glass of wine it was a beautiful end of the day.</p>
