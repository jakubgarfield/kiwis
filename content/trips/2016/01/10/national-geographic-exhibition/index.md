Rainy weekends are a bit boring here in Wellington and it’s usually challenging to make up a plan which would provide a feeling of satisfaction when you summarize your time on the Sunday evenings.

During days like that, when the weather forecast shows continuous rain for a whole day, I’m usually desperately looking for any interesting museum, exhibition or other indoor activity. In the meanwhile, Jakub is desperately looking for some time under the blanket.

On a rainy Saturday, we decided to visit Palmerston North which hosted a National Geographic Exhibition at that time. The exhibition presented a collection of the best  pictures which had been taken and issued in NG magazines and even when we’d already seen most of them before, it was great to see the photos at one place all together.

However, besides the exhibition, there wasn’t really much to visit in Palmerston. So, no matter how impressive the photos were, we had to admit that our decision was a bit poor as we spent about an hour in gallery compared to four long hours on the road.
