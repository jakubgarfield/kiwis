    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/7.jpg" alt="Mt Holdsworth Jumbo Circuit" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/holdsworthjumbocircuit"&gt;Mt Holdsworth Jumbo Circuit&lt;/a&gt; is a classic tramp in Tararuas and we had been planning to undertake it for ages. Unfortunately, the mountain range is afflicted by strong winds for most of the year and as the best part of the track follows an exposed ridge, it might be quite dangerous with gusts well over 100&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An exposed ridge can be quite windy -- over 100km/h is pretty common" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An exposed ridge can be quite windy &amp;#8211; over 100km/h is pretty common&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, we had been waiting and hoping that one day the good weather would come. Eventually, after a few previous cancellations, a window of sunny three days&amp;nbsp;appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A start of the track is about an hour and a half drive from Wellington. The track can be done in one day but we decided to split it into two and stay over the night at &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/tararua-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/jumbo-hut/"&gt;Jumbo Hut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The green hills of Tararuas" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The green hills of Tararuas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off early. After signing into a visitor book at Holdsworth Lodge, we carried on along a steep path of Gentle Annie Track. A fresh crispy air cooled us down but not quickly enough because once we reached the Rocky Lookout, a short side trip from the main track, we were both&amp;nbsp;sweat-drenched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Rocky Lookout defeated!" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Rocky Lookout defeated!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rocky Lookout offered nice views of Wairarapa below and on the other side, above the bush line, we could see &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/tararua-forest-park/things-to-do/huts/powell-hut/"&gt;Powell Hut&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/03/30/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/"&gt;lunch break&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The view over Wairarapa" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The view over Wairarapa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the track ascended gradually up to Mountain House Shelter which used to be a proper mountain hut back in the days. From there, it rose steeply up to the hill and we had to climb a number of steps before we got above the dense&amp;nbsp;bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it was a beautiful day, there was nobody around Powell Hut. It was a really good timing because just a few minutes after we had left, a helicopter started to supply the hut with&amp;nbsp;firewood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/14.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A narrow ridge leading to Jumbo Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/14.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A narrow ridge leading to Jumbo Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Powell Hut the track followed the ridge up to the Mt Holdsworth trig which offered great views of Wairarapa on one side and Tararua Range on the other. In the distance, the dense white clouds were rolling over the hills like giant waves falling down into deep&amp;nbsp;valleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The rolling clouds in the distance" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The rolling clouds in the distance&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we descended from the peak and carried on to Jumbo Hut, the cloud reached Mt Holdsworth and covered it entirely disabling any views. We felt sorry for a bunch of people who passed us in the opposite direction and were heading to the&amp;nbsp;summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="There used to be the Mt Holdsworth summit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/13.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There used to be the Mt Holdsworth summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section between Mt Holdsworth and Jumbo Peak was quite challenging. Despite the favourable weather, the wind gusts along the ridge were strong and the path leading among tussock was hardly recognizable. Besides that, as there had been some heavy rain a few days before, it was really&amp;nbsp;muddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Jumbo Peak, we enjoyed some more amazing views but as the clouds started to roll over the nearest hills, we didn’t stay for long and rather quickly carried on to Jumbo&amp;nbsp;Hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/17.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The clouds were getting closer and closer" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/17.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The clouds were getting closer and closer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other people made use of nice weather and at the end of the evening, the hut was almost full. It’s always interesting to see what other people are willing to carry in their backpacks. This time it was a pocket version of board game Settlers of Catan, a big lolly bag and hot chocolate (surprisingly no&amp;nbsp;marshmallows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/22.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The sunrise at Jumbo Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/22.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The sunrise at Jumbo Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning, after a half of the people met in front of the hut to watch the sunrise, we set off to finish the rest of the&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/30.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fields of gold" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/30.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fields of gold&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steep descent to Atiwhakatu Hut was quite tiring, especially for our knees but once we got there, the track ran along the river with an easy&amp;nbsp;grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/32.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The amazing forest on the way to Atiwhakatu Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/32.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The amazing forest on the way to Atiwhakatu Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed a couple of junctions with alternative ways to Mt Holdsworth and after a few kilometers reached the one where we had made the first turn to Gentle Annie Track the previous&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/34.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Atiwhakatu Stream near the hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/34.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Atiwhakatu Stream near the hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before we arrived at the car park, we walked through the last section of the track, the Donnelly Flat, which is also a great area for picnics and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBQ&lt;/span&gt; as there are fire pits&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/36.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A good wrap up was essential in the chilly morning" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/36.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A good wrap up was essential in the chilly morning&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it was worth waiting all that time until the weather was reasonable because we could fully enjoy this gem of Tararuas. Definitely&amp;nbsp;recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/9.jpg" alt="Tongariro Northern Circuit" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food is neatly sorted out into single zip bags, clothes and a tent are in backpacks. Our four-wheel hotel is ready to go. After we’d made the very popular &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/01/tongariro-alpine-crossing/"&gt;Tongariro Alpine Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to use one of the long weekends and undertake the less touristic &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/central-north-island/places/tongariro-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/tongariro-northern-circuit/"&gt;Tongariro Northern Circuit&lt;/a&gt;. Our first Great&amp;nbsp;Walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Late summer and there is still some snow on top of Mt Ruapehu" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Late summer and there is still some snow on top of Mt Ruapehu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a four hours long drive, we arrived at &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/central-north-island/places/tongariro-national-park/things-to-do/campsites/mangahuia-campsite/"&gt;Mangahuia campsite&lt;/a&gt; where we spent the night. The campground had all necessary facilities and also plenty of space. The more we were surprised when we woke up and there was another car parked right next to&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beginning of the Tongariro Northern Circuit -- Bara is fresh and excited" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Beginning of the Tongariro Northern Circuit &amp;#8211; Bara is fresh and excited&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we drove over to Whakapapa Village where the track begins. We were going to walk the circuit anti-clockwise but it is possible to make it in either&amp;nbsp;direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Already well-known Taranaki Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Already well-known Taranaki Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sections to Taranaki Falls as well as to Tama Lakes were easy and even with heavy backpacks the distance went quickly by. We’d already known those sections from our previous &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/06/07/tama-lakes/"&gt;winter trips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The historic Maihohonu hut -- the oldest existing mountain hut in New Zealand" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The historic Maihohonu hut &amp;#8211; the oldest existing mountain hut in New Zealand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path led among tussock and shrubs and on the right-hand side Mt Ruapehu hid its snow-covered top in gray clouds. All the way to historic Waihohonu Hut we hardly met any other&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunset at Waihohonu Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sunset at Waihohonu Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at new Waihohonu Hut, the place we were going to stay over the night, we still had a plenty of time for a side trip to Ohinepango Springs. The springs bubbling up from the old lava flow were only 30min walk from the hut. By the time we went back for dinner, the clouds cleared up a bit and the sky turned into an amazing colorful sunset&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="It tasted better than it looked, especially after hours of hiking" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;It tasted better than it looked, especially after hours of hiking&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Waihohonu campsite was located a few meters down from the hut and it was set up right next to the stream which made a relaxing burbling background for&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mt Ruapehu again, this time with clear sky" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mt Ruapehu again, this time with clear sky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up to a beautiful sunny day. As it was going to be the most arduous day from all three, we hit the trail early. The path went up and down across stream valleys and our backpacks were definitely heavier than the previous&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara is still excited but not so fresh anymore" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara is still excited but not so fresh anymore&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parched gravel field spread all around with occasional plants and a perfect cone of Mt Ngauruhoe was in nice contrast with blue&amp;nbsp;sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A desert landscape on the way to Oturere Hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A desert landscape on the way to Oturere Hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about two hours we reached the Oturere Hut where we made a break and had some refreshment. We found out that staying in Oturere Hut for the first night would probably have been a more convenient option and would have made the second day much&amp;nbsp;easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A little pearl in the volcanic desert -- Gentiana bellidifolia" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A little pearl in the volcanic desert &amp;#8211; Gentiana bellidifolia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we carried on towards Emerald Lakes, the landscape changed again and the path weaves through jagged lava&amp;nbsp;formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section to Emerald lakes was a 200m altitude steep ascend and I think that we stopped every few meters to catch a breath. It was such a relieve when we finally got over the edge and spotted the&amp;nbsp;lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of Emerald lakes" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of Emerald lakes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, the track merged up with Tongariro Crossing track. The number of tourists rocketed and we watched them how they were slowly descending from Red Crater down to the Central Crater. Like a line of ants. As we crawled uphill, we had to be quite careful as some people moved a bit clumsily in loose volcanic&amp;nbsp;debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The weather had changed rapidly before we reached the Red Crater" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/13.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The weather had changed rapidly before we reached the Red Crater&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, by the time we reached the top of Red Crater, everything around had got covered by dense clouds and it started to drizzle. Despite our tiredness, we decided to do the side trip to Mt Tongariro summit as we skipped that one during our last time at &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/01/tongariro-alpine-crossing/"&gt;Tongariro Crossing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/14.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="See you later, backpacks" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/14.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;See you later, backpacks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately one and half hour return walk followed the ridge and required a few climbs over the rocks. When we got further from the busy junction with Tongariro Crossing trail, we just left our backpacks next to the one of rock formation and carried to the summit without them. We were suddenly about 12kg&amp;nbsp;lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/15.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Tongariro Summit Track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/15.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;View from Tongariro Summit Track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as we would have planned it, when we reached the summit the clouds cleared up and we had a great view of South Crater whose slopes created an amazing combination of all brown, orange and gray shades. On the other side was a totally different view of gradually sloping hill with valleys eroded by a number of the little&amp;nbsp;streams&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/16.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Tongariro Summit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/16.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;View from Tongariro Summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning back to the junction, the main track steeply descended. We crossed the wide South Crater and then climbed down a number of steps before we reached Soda Springs. From there, it was already an easy 30 min walk on the wooden platform and in the distance we could see the roof of the Mangatepopo Hut – our final destination for the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/17.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A beautiful sunset at Mangatepopo Hut -- a reward for all our effort" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/17.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A beautiful sunset at Mangatepopo Hut &amp;#8211; a reward for all our effort&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day, we had to finish the last section between Mangatepopo Hut and Whakapapa Village. The weather was nice and from some points along the track, we had a nice view of surrounding volcanoes. But even though, it was probably the least exciting part of the whole track as most of the time the path led through dense shrub and we could not see&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/18.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lost in the shrubs" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/18.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lost in the shrubs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 3 hours, the track merged with Taranaki Falls track and we could cool our tired feet in Wairere stream before we finished the last bit and came to Whakapapa&amp;nbsp;Village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-northern-circuit/19.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="For the last time -- Mt Ruapehu" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-northern-circuit/19.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;For the last time &amp;#8211; Mt Ruapehu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the Tongariro Northern Circuit was definitely worth all the effort and sweating. With great views, fewer tourists on the track and nice camping spots we gave it our preference to its shorter Tongariro Alpine Crossing version. Definitely one of our most favorite hikes, so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/4.jpg" alt="Chilly hiking in Nelson Lakes National Park" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning we woke up in the tent which was totally covered with frost as the temperature during the night dropped down close to -8°C. Luckily for us, our sleeping bags stood this test without any problem and the only frozen parts of our bodies were our&amp;nbsp;noses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waiting for sunrise at Lake Rotoiti" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Waiting for sunrise at Lake Rotoiti&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were cooking breakfast, the fog was lazily rolling over Lake Rotoiti and the sun beams slowly lighted up the hillsides around. It seemed that another beautiful day was ahead of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Out of the breath on the top of St Arnaud Range" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Out of the breath on the top of St Arnaud Range&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d planned to undertake the &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/nelson-marlborough/nelson-lakes-short-walks-brochure.pdf"&gt;St Arnaud Range track&lt;/a&gt;. It started as a steady climb through beech forest but shortly changed to a tough steep ascent. The zigzag path seemed to be endless and the light shining through stunted trees always gave us the wishful thinking that we were close to the&amp;nbsp;top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The endless ascent through beech forest " src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The endless ascent through beech forest &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when we passed at least the fiftieth bend, we got above the bushline and reached Parachutes Rocks after a few minutes. What a view! All that sweat and pant were absolutely worth it. The blue waters of Lake Rotoiti glittered beneath and the snowy tops of Robert ridge where we’d walked &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/08/16/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/"&gt;the previous day&lt;/a&gt; stretched in front of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jakub pretending deep interest in views from Parachutes Rocks" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jakub pretending deep interest in views from Parachutes Rocks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short break, we carried on up to the ridge line. At first, we followed the path beaten in tussock but then, when it disappeared under the snow, we just followed the other hikers’ prints. As we were climbing up to the steep hill, I started to be a bit worried about how we would get back because some sections were pretty slippery. Moreover, we met a few really well-equipped hikers with crampons and ice axes who made the situation look even more&amp;nbsp;serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Amazing views of Nelson Lake area" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazing views of Nelson Lake area&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were getting closer to the top, I was really excited what’s on the other side of the ridge. The last few meters and we got there! The other side revealed the snow-covered Wairau Valley with small lakes in its basins. The 360-degree view of surrounding area was spectacular with all the green and white hills rolling on the&amp;nbsp;horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of the other side - snowy Wairau Valley" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the other side - snowy Wairau Valley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the way back wasn’t as bad as I’d thought and we got down without any problem. However, some people had decided that sliding the hill on their butts would be even “safer” way of descending. In the end, I was more worried about them than about&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Crossing the stream on the way to falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Crossing the stream on the way to falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we still had a half of the day before we had to head off back to Picton. We spent that time walking along the shore of the lake and in less than a couple of hours we reached &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/nelson-marlborough/nelson-lakes-short-walks-brochure.pdf"&gt;Whiskey falls&lt;/a&gt;. This almost 40 meters high waterfall was hidden among the trees and ferns just a few meters beside the main&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Whiskey Falls named after a bottle of whiskey found at the site&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we enjoyed the last few views over Lake Rotoiti but then it was time to pack all the stuff and set out back to&amp;nbsp;Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The last view before saying goodbye to Lake Rotoiti" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-hiking-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/08/16/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/10.jpg" alt="Chilly camping in Nelson Lakes National Park" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Friday afternoon. Everything was packed and the car was ready. I printed last few maps, our ferry tickets and then we headed off to &lt;a href="https://www.interislander.co.nz/"&gt;Wellington ferry terminal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A quick warm-up while climbing up to Mt Robert" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A quick warm-up while climbing up to Mt Robert&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sign that something was wrong was that we were the only car at check-in. No queue as usual. At the gate, there was a notice that check-in would be an hour beyond its scheduled time. A bit annoyed, as we hadn’t received any notice, we drove to the terminal to find out what was going on. A few minutes later, all our weekend plans almost blew&amp;nbsp;up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Grass and mose still around but snow wasn't far" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Grass and mose still around but snow wasn&amp;#8217;t far&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, by mistake, I’d booked the tickets in the wrong direction and instead of in Wellington, they expected us to board in Picton. Within a sec, our annoyance turned into kindness as we tried to re-book our tickets at a counter and save heaps of money. Luckily, there were free spots on the next boat and a salesman was really nice. So eventually, we departed just with a little&amp;nbsp;delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A kingdom of ice and snow" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A kingdom of ice and snow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first night we spent in &lt;a href="http://www.yha.co.nz/hostels/south-island-hostels/yha-picton/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YHA&lt;/span&gt; in Picton&lt;/a&gt; and carried on to the Nelson Lakes the next day. In the morning, a fog rolled over Picton but by the time we arrived at St Arnaud, the sun was shining and the blue sky indicated a beautiful&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lake Rotoiti and our campground down there" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lake Rotoiti and our campground down there&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/footer-links/contact-us/office-by-name/?office=K1024"&gt;Nelson Lakes Visitor Centre&lt;/a&gt; we bought our campsite ticket and got information about track conditions as there was already snow on the top of the hills. We abandoned our intention to reach the Angelus Hut as equipment like crampons and ice axes were required. Later, we found out&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jakub - the mountaineer" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jakub - the mountaineer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the goal for the afternoon was &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/nelson-lakes-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/mount-robert-circuit/?region=nelsontasman&amp;amp;park=09e4a9dc-2578-433e-abb9-670c0794579b&amp;amp;activity=walking-tramping#activitypanel"&gt;Mt Robert Circuit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the chilly morning, the initial steep zigzag part of the track quickly warmed us up. Through beech forest we climbed up to the open ridge top which with its great views of Lake Rotoiti and hills all around served as an ideal place for our classic hiking lunch - &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/03/30/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/"&gt;cheese and crackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Green slopes and white tops of St Arnaud Range" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Green slopes and white tops of St Arnaud Range&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we passed Relax Shelter, patches of snow started appearing among clumps of grass. There was still plenty of daylight when we reached the junction to Paddy’s Track so we carried on a little bit further along the ridge towards Lake Angelus. The wind on the exposed ridge was pretty cold and soon we had to follow the path beaten in snow by previous&amp;nbsp;hikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Our dinner" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our dinner&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About one kilometer further, there was a nice flat top with amazing views of sharp mountains ahead as well as deep basin below. All covered in snow. Along the rocky ridge, we could see silhouettes of other hikes, hopefully, better equipped than us because peaks looked&amp;nbsp;icy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we descended back to the junction and finished the rest of the circuit along Paddy’s&amp;nbsp;Track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Still a fair bit to climb" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Still a fair bit to climb&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really tough part of the day, however, began after wed finished the track. With the sun going down by the hill, all the warmth disappeared and the temperature dropped considerably. Pinned to the gas stove, we warmed ourselves a bit while we were cooking dinner but in the open kitchen, we couldn’t stand for&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The first camping experience with temperatures way below zero" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/chilly-camping-in-nelson-lakes-national-park/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first camping experience with temperatures way below zero&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the earliest bedtime ever but as our fluffy sleeping bags were the only place where we could survive, there was no other option then spent the rest of the evening like two snuggled&amp;nbsp;caterpillars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/07/19/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/11.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Day in Hobart Among Devils and Art" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eight days of travelling around Tasmania, we finished the loop back in Hobart. Here we had almost the entire day for some extra roaming before getting to the airport to catch a plane back&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Hobart from Mt Wellington" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Hobart from Mt Wellington&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our travel, we had seen quite a lot of wildlife but we hadn’t been lucky enough to spot a local iconic symbol - the Tasmanian devil. As we could not leave without seeing at least one, our first thing to do was a visit of &lt;a href="http://bonorong.com.au/"&gt;Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Face to face meeting with a kangaroo mate" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Face to face meeting with a kangaroo mate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People at Bonorong focus on rescue wildlife program and they work towards getting their animals back to the wild. A lot of animals got there after a collision with a car. The number of animals killed on the roads is huge what we actually could witness ourselves during our travel. We met heaps of carcasses along the roadsides and a few times we luckily managed to stop just before a collision with an&amp;nbsp;animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Yummy carrot with oats for breakfast" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Yummy carrot with oats for breakfast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we arrived early, there were only a few people around. At the entrance, we both got a small bag of granular kangaroo food and then carried on to the park. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat"&gt;wombats&lt;/a&gt; already ranked among our favourite animals but here they became even more adorable. One of them didn’t stop following its carer while the man was sweeping its pan. Three younger ones were munching their fresh breakfast. But when we saw two six-month-old hiding behind a carer’s legs and demanding for a rub - it was a peak of cuteness. It was hard to imagine that once the wombats turn about two years they become quite&amp;nbsp;aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Small cuddly wombats running around" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Small cuddly wombats running around&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a bit further, another carer was giving a talk to a group of Asians about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_devil"&gt;tasmanian devils&lt;/a&gt;. When we took our eyes off wombats and came closer to the group, two Tasmanian devils had been already poking their noses out of the den. After a while, they came out completely. In Bonorong, they are running a breeding program for those endangered&amp;nbsp;animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sniff, sniff, sniff" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sniff, sniff, sniff&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That morning we spent a bit of time among kangaroos which skipped around a large open area and from time to time they ate dry kangaroo food from visitors’ hands. The kangaroos were quite friendly and as we offered them the feed, they grabbed our hand in their paws and slowly crunched it. The kangaroo I fed was obviously hungry because when it finished the first handful of granules, it demanded more by pushing its muzzle to my&amp;nbsp;pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara feeding a joey" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara feeding a joey&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we left Bonorong Sanctuary, our next stop was at &lt;a href="http://www.wellingtonpark.org.au/"&gt;Mt Wellington&lt;/a&gt; where a lookout at the summit provided an awesome view of the city below and coastal area. The mountain was more than 1200m high and despite a nice autumn day, it was pretty cold on the top. So, instead of an initially planned walk, we just had a look from various platforms around the summit but then went back to the heated car.&amp;nbsp;Chickens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sheltered lookout on Mt Wellington" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sheltered lookout on Mt Wellington&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both like &lt;a href="http://gardens.rtbg.tas.gov.au/"&gt;botanical gardens&lt;/a&gt;. Those quiet places with a number of winding paths, glasshouses with humid air and generally because of their melancholic and kind of old-fashioned atmosphere. Therefore, whenever we visit a new town and there is enough time, we go at least for a short&amp;nbsp;stroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rock formation on top of the mountain" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rock formation on top of the mountain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this time, my winner section was an Oak Collection. The leaves on trees had already started to change their colors and they slowly passed from yellow into shades of orange and red. A few of them had fallen off and covered the grass. It was one of those nice days when you can smell autumn all around. The real autumn which we don’t have here in&amp;nbsp;Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Colours of Autumn" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Colours of Autumn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in the autumn sun we started to feel a bit cold after a while but still had a couple of hours. So, we decided to be cultural once in a while and visited one of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt;’s in Hobart - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MONA.&lt;/span&gt; The famous Tasmanian Museum of Old and New&amp;nbsp;Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Big pictures" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Big pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection included everything from an ancient mummy to obese swollen Ferrari. Some stuff was quite beyond our comprehension but a few pieces of installations were pretty cool. For instance, words formed from falling drops of water, a tunnel with special acoustics installation or words which could be read only with peripheral vision. Interesting was even building itself. The three-floor subterrane concrete colossus built into the side of a cliff with no windows was like a dark mysterious&amp;nbsp;labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An acoustic tunnel" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An acoustic tunnel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the creepiest thing about this place is that most museums offer a lifetime membership but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MONA&lt;/span&gt; goes beyond that. They offer &lt;a href="http://www.mona.net.au/mona/Cemetery"&gt;Eternity Membership&lt;/a&gt; – a membership that lasts even after your death. So, if you are really into art, you can enjoy it truly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jtpf8N5IDE"&gt;forever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wall covered with small pictures" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-day-in-hobart-among-devils-and-art/13.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/8.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Two Capes and Tasman Peninsula" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/06/07/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/"&gt;Freycinet Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, we carried on down to the south to Tasman Peninsula where we were going to stay following two&amp;nbsp;nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The winding path to Cape Hauy" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The winding path to Cape Hauy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we turned off the main road to our campsite at Fortescue Bay, the road more resembled a tank training area than anything else. After 45 minutes slalom drive, we finally reached the campsite. It was a really, basic, but nice area in the forest and a few meters from the beach. Much to Jakub’s delight, each campsite had a small campfire ring. So, we spent the rest of the afternoon looking for brushwood and leftover firewood near other campsites. Much to my&amp;nbsp;delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The campfire is set up -- let’s make dinner!" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The campfire is set up &amp;#8211; let’s make dinner!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we planned the track to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1533"&gt;Cape Hauy&lt;/a&gt;. The first part of the track was identical with the &lt;a href="http://www.threecapestrack.com.au/index.html"&gt;Three Capes Track&lt;/a&gt; which is a quite recently opened multi-day hike.  Unfortunately, as we didn’t have time to do the whole 3-4 day track, we had to be happy only with a little tasting of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The finish of Three Capes Track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The finish of Three Capes Track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The part of the track which passed through woodland was quite easy and nothing unexpected happened. Except the thing that I almost stepped on a small &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-lipped_snake"&gt;white-lipped snake&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, as we found out on info table when we came to our campsite, it wasn’t very dangerous&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The rock formation of Cape Hauy" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The rock formation of Cape Hauy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we passed the trail junction, left heading to the Three Capes Track, we carried on towards the cape and suddenly, the great views of steep cliffs and rock formations appeared. On the top of the headland, there was a small lookout platform. Even with its safety bars I shortly hesitated to come closer to the edge. I can’t help myself but I always have to think about the worse things which might happen at places like this. No matter how unrealistic my visions are. Obviously, it was no issue for people who had chosen two huge poles sticking out of the sea for their climbing&amp;nbsp;target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The thrilling view from the lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The thrilling view from the lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the track, we spent the rest of the afternoon exploring the near surrounding and had a look at Tasmans Arch,  Devils Kitchen or Tasman Blowholes. All of those are easily accessible spots with some nice&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The panoramic views stretched far south" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The panoramic views stretched far south&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we stopped at Port Arthur, a tiny town recommended by travel book, to find out that nothing interesting was there. Unless you were a fan of &lt;a href="http://portarthur.org.au/"&gt;historic convict sites&lt;/a&gt; or wanted to take one of ghost tours which we did not. On the other hand, a few more kilometers far away, there was a place called Remarkable Cave, which was definitely worth the&amp;nbsp;drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The light at the end of the tunnel of Remarkable Cave" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The light at the end of the tunnel of Remarkable Cave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived back to the campsite, we &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt; have spent the last few moments of daylight collecting the firewood. I have to admit that it was fantastic sitting at the fire later in the cold night sipping the tea and enjoying the heat. It didn’t take long and a couple of possums came closer as well. They probably hoped for something to eat but with our minimum supplies we had, we couldn’t afford any losses. They should have rather visited one of the resorts which our neighbours built up around. It was incredible what some people brought for a single weekend or even one&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Just keep the safe distance from the edge" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Just keep the safe distance from the edge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, the walk to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1536"&gt;Cape Raoul&lt;/a&gt; had been on the list before we headed off back to Hobart. The weather wasn’t really pleasant and the moment we stepped out from the forest on the open rock plateau covered only with shrub, we were almost blown away by strong wind. Walk along the edge provided heaps of stunning views and in the deep beneath us, we also noticed a small colony of seals. Their sharp barking was hearable even in the strong&amp;nbsp;wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The shrub is bent by some of the strongest recorded winds in Australia" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The shrub is bent by some of the strongest recorded winds in Australia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we just one more time enjoyed the view of amazing cliffs and swirling sea from a small clearing before we plunged into woodland and hurried up back to the car park because there were still a few hours of driving ahead of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The was a seal colony somewhere in the deep" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The was a seal colony somewhere in the deep&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with the walk to Cape Raoul, we wrapped up our exploring of Tasman Peninsula and actually the exploring of the whole Tasmanian nature as well. In the evening, we were going to be back in a big city and there was some exciting stuff planned for our last&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Apart from the strong winds, this place lacked fresh water as well." src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-two-capes-and-tasman-peninsula/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Apart from the strong winds, this place lacked fresh water as well.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/3.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; golden beaches of Freycinet Peninsula" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning we left Cradle Mountain, the weather wasn’t really nice and therefore our transfer to Freycinet Peninsula was more like a road trip instead of undertaking any longer&amp;nbsp;tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way, we made a short turn-off to Mount Claude Lookout. Just before we approached the top of the hill, a little animal was crossing the road. It was an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna"&gt;echidna&lt;/a&gt;. Something between a hedgehog and a porcupine (but only at first sign). It safely crossed the road and carried on sniffling around with it’s tiny muzzle, probably looking for some juicy&amp;nbsp;ants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A spiky little creature in pursuit of a lunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to the east coast, we made only a few short stops – for lunch, to buy a bottle of a local wine and to have a look over surrounding vineyards and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting_Lagoon_Important_Bird_Area"&gt;Moulting Lagoon&lt;/a&gt; from lookout next to Cherry Tree&amp;nbsp;Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of wineries and Moulting Lagoon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we arrived to Coles Bay where we were going to stay over the night, we stretched our legs a little bit during a short walk on &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1450"&gt;Friendly Beaches&lt;/a&gt;. With sunny weather it must be a beautiful beach with its white sand and it probably has some good waves for surfing too. Unfortunately, when we got there, it started to rain and with cloudy sky everything looked a bit dull. But so what, we are not made of&amp;nbsp;sugar…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of a rocky beach" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of a rocky beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pitching our tent at Coles Bay campground, there was still some time to go and have a look at &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1462"&gt;Cape Tourville Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; which was about 15 minute drive from the camp. An easy circuit allows for stupendous views of coastal cliffs and infinite blueness Tasman&amp;nbsp;Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A lighthouse. Bara likes it. Jakub finds it as every other lighthouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we made one last turn-off which followed the Sleepy Bay track down to the beach (there was nothing exciting), but then we drove back to the campsite as it was slowly getting&amp;nbsp;dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An orange Sleepy Bay in the background" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An orange Sleepy Bay in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning, we needed to change a climb to Mt Amos for &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1478"&gt;Hazards Beach Circuit&lt;/a&gt; as it’d been raining for the last few days and we were informed that it’s not safe to undertake the track because of slippery boulders. After the similar experience we’d had in &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/05/17/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/"&gt;Cradle Mountains&lt;/a&gt; we agreed to take the alternative&amp;nbsp;walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track to Mt Amos was closed as it was too slippery" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The track to Mt Amos was closed as it was too slippery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first the part of the track which was a bit crowded even when we started early in the morning. But most of the people reached the Wineglass Bay Lookout and turned back, so as we went down from the lookout to the beach, we barely met anybody. There we sat for a couple of minutes and watched waves rushing to the shore and crashing against white sand&amp;nbsp;beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wineglass Bay Lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Wineglass Bay Lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track then continued further through low-lying marshy area to the Hazards Beach. Except one or two wallabies, we didn’t meet anybody there. On the beach, there were heaps of Paua and other shells washed out and as we walked along, we made a little&amp;nbsp;collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Golden sands of Hazard Beach" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Golden sands of Hazard Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section of the circuit provided some good views of the Great Oyster Bay and also of rocky peaks of The Hazards. Before we got back to the carpark we spotted another curious wallaby and one really, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REALLY&lt;/span&gt; ugly spider. That was exactly why we shook out our shoes every day in the morning. Just in&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bara's collection of shells" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Bara&amp;#8217;s collection of shells&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way from the Freycinet National Park we stopped at a little oyster market where they also served freshly made seafood and fish meals. Jakub tried his fabled lobster which eventually turned out to be not fabled at all. So, he was a bit disappointed but my garlic salmon was&amp;nbsp;delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The not so delicious dreamed of lobster" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-golden-beaches-of-freycinet-peninsula/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The not so delicious dreamed of lobster&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was time to carry on to the south towards our last destination - Tasman&amp;nbsp;Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/6.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; Cradle Mountain Summit" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We woke up to the chilly but sunny morning in Cradle Mountain where we were going to stay for the next two days. The &lt;a href="https://www.discoveryholidayparks.com.au/tas/cradle_mountain/cradle_mountain"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; we’d booked had a convenient location close to a bunch of tracks and a really nice&amp;nbsp;setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="That’s where we started -- on the other side of Dove Lake" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;That’s where we started &amp;#8211; on the other side of Dove Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just on the way to the camp kitchen, we met a couple of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaby"&gt;wallabies&lt;/a&gt; wandering around tents. The kitchen had a big fireplace which kept the whole room nice and cosy even when the temperature outside were only slightly above zero&amp;nbsp;degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick breakfast, we jumped into the car and drove to Lake Dove where we’d planned to spend a day on&amp;nbsp;hiking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The goal for today -- the Cradle Mountain Summit" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The goal for today &amp;#8211; the Cradle Mountain Summit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite early in the morning, but the car park next to Dove Lake was packed with tourist. There was a large group of Germans getting ready to set off the track and heaps of Asians taking pictures of everything around. But one could not wonder because the morning panorama of the rocky mountains behind the blue lake was&amp;nbsp;stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The morning cloud covering the Cradle Mountain" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The morning cloud covering the Cradle Mountain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shortly looked around as well but then set off towards Lake Lila. As most people chose a shorter walk around Lake Dove, we managed to avoid the biggest crowd. We followed the path up to Wombat Pool, passed Wombat Peak and also spotted a few wombats’ poos. A wombat is obviously a big thing&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chilling on a bench at Wombat Pool" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Chilling on a bench at Wombat Pool&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were clambering to the Marions Lookout, we overtook a few people with huge backpacks who were undertaking the &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=7771"&gt;Overland Track&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to do the entire 6-day walk, and therefore we chose the &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1362"&gt;Summit Track&lt;/a&gt; to walk at least a little bit of it. And without the additional 20 kg on our backs it was much nicer&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An amazing blue colour of Crater Lake" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An amazing blue colour of Crater Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climb to Marions Lookout was definitely worth the effort. During a refreshing break we were enjoying the amazing views of surroundings – deep blue lakes beneath us, jagged mountains behind&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view from Marions Lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view from Marions Lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there to Kitchen’s Hut, the walk across the Cradle Plateau was flat and easy, but then it started to ascend and ended up almost as a 300 m vertical climb.  Roughly in the middle of the slope, the beaten path disappeared and the crawling across big rocks followed. About 80 m below the summit, my fear of heights won and I decided to wait for Jakub as he tried to reach the summit. However, even he gave up and came back after a while because the boulders were quite slippery due to rain from the previous night. Nevertheless, the views of the landscape were still&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Still on the beaten path but not for too long" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Still on the beaten path but not for too long&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we steeply descended to Lake Wilks and further to the shore of Lake Dove where we connected to the wooden path of &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1318"&gt;Dove Lake Circuit&lt;/a&gt;. The path ran through a tranquil area known as The Ballroom Forest with ancient myrtles and&amp;nbsp;beeches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A maize from roots while walking through the forest" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A maize from roots while walking through the forest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit further, we suddenly heard a crackling noise in the bush. After a few minutes of listening and trying to identify that thing, we saw a grey fur. And then a nose. &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/04/27/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/"&gt;Another wombat&lt;/a&gt; on lunch&amp;nbsp;expedition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A jagged summit of Cradle Mountain" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A jagged summit of Cradle Mountain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the easier Dove Lake Circuit, this section of the track was quite busy. When we reached the Boat Shed, it was literally overcrowded. It was almost impossible to take a picture which wouldn’t include a tourist on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A rare short moment without tourists at Boat Shed" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A rare short moment without tourists at Boat Shed&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to our campsite, we were lucky one more time when a little furry walked across the road. Fortunately, we were driving slowly enough because it stopped right in the middle, casually rubbed its butt and then carried on in the pursuit of some tasty&amp;nbsp;grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Enchanted walk along the edges of Pencil Pine Creek" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-cradle-mountain-summit/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Enchanted walk along the edges of Pencil Pine Creek&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up the day with a short &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1359"&gt;Enchanted walk&lt;/a&gt; along a creek through an old rainforest but then continued to our camp for dinner. And that was it for our time in Cradle Mountains because the next day we were slowly moving to the coast of &lt;a href="http://www.discovertasmania.com.au/about/national-parks-and-wilderness/freycinet-national-park-wineglass-bay"&gt;Freycinet Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/6.jpg" alt="Tasmania&amp;#58; on the way to Cradle Mountains" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning at Lake St Clair was cold and cloudy. It was the first time when we’d really appreciated our warm sleeping bags because until then we’d always woken up sweating almost every time we’d used&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snuggling in the chilly morning at Lake St Clair" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Snuggling in the chilly morning at Lake St Clair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial intention of taking photos of sunrise above the lake had to be replaced by taking mysterious photos with the fog rolling above the water surface. After a few attempts, which ended up with a long black blur because Jakub didn’t run and climb quickly enough on a big boulder, we finally managed to take a shot of the two of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view from King William Saddle" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view from King William Saddle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to our tent, we found a proper camp kitchen with all equipment and a fireplace. It was a nice change after cooking in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBQ&lt;/span&gt; shelter the night before because we’d thought, by mistake, that it had been the only kitchen there. An Australian friendly older couple kept us company for breakfast. They were quite excited about our &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/04/13/tasmania-lake-st-clair-and-tiger-snake/"&gt;snake adventure&lt;/a&gt; from the previous day and the guy also told us how many time he’d been bitten by a snake just during last&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then it was time to set&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An emerald valley from Donaghys Lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An emerald valley from Donaghys Lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we reached the King William Saddle, the clouds had got melted and the sun had come out. We made our first little stop at &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1561"&gt;Franklin River&lt;/a&gt;, where there was an easy 25 minutes nature trail. The walk ran along the wild river and through the cool temperate rainforest. It was nice for stretching our legs but, otherwise, nothing really&amp;nbsp;special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Iconic Frenchmans Cap" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Iconic Frenchmans Cap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further along the road, there was another short walk which climbed up to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1564"&gt;Donaghys Lookout&lt;/a&gt;. This walk was a more satisfying one as from the top it offered a great view of skyline with peaky mountains and a wide emerald valley spread down below&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Munching through the sandwich at the Nelson Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Munching through the sandwich at the Nelson Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thirds short walk was one to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1568"&gt;Nelson Falls&lt;/a&gt;. Again, it was an easy but really nice stretch through the forest when we walked along a little stream before we ended up in front of the waterfall. That time, there wasn’t much water running in the stream but still it was a cool little&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A mine near Queenstown" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A mine near Queenstown&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, when we arrived at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queenstown,_Tasmania"&gt;Queenstown&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to stop and refill our supplies because it looked like the last bigger town on the way to our campsite. Obviously, a reasonable amount of money has been invested in keeping the little old mining town attractive but to us, it looked more creepy and actually quite sad. We dropped the idea to stay for coffee and rather carried on. But it should be noted that the local shop was well&amp;nbsp;supplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chilling under the height of Montezuma Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Chilling under the height of Montezuma Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last stop of the day before heading off straight to our campsite were &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=1374"&gt;Montezuma Falls&lt;/a&gt;. As we were a bit running out of time, we set a fast pace along the historic tramway and reached the waterfall in less than one hour. Just before the falls, there was an old little tunnel in the rock. And we had a torch! For those who don’t like spider webs and spiders, it’s better to go without it. At least, you don’t see them and the tunnel was blocked up after a few meters&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The feared swing bridge" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The feared swing bridge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare to Nelson, the Montezuma falls were narrow and high — 104m. Immediately below the falls, there was a swing bridge over the creek. It reminded me how a bad head for heights I have. So, I rather waited on the bank while Jakub was exploring the other&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Our new mate, Rusty, sniffing in the meadows" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tasmania-on-the-way-to-cradle-mountains/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our new mate, Rusty, sniffing in the meadows&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Montezuma Falls, we carried on to &lt;a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3297"&gt;Cradle Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The weather was getting worse and we were worried about putting our tent together in the rain. We were about approaching the campsite when we met a highlight of the day. A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat"&gt;wombat&lt;/a&gt;! It was just standing next to the road, noshing the grass and absolutely didn’t bother when Jakub was taking a picture of it. The 40 kg of cuteness at the end of the day.&amp;nbsp;Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
