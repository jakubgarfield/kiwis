        &lt;p&gt;Halfway through our way to Waihi Falls this astonishing landscape open and left us speechless staring into the blue and green for several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/1.jpg" alt="Hiking food for a 3 day track" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food plays an important part on your hike. It keeps your energy levels up throughout the day and enables you to regenerate over the night. On a three day hike, you don’t have to make a big science out of it as you can pig out later when you get back home, but it’s still nice to have a good meal in the evening and be ready for the next&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your food to be light, packable, nutritious and reasonably tasty. Tin of tuna in an olive oil is nutritious, tastes delicious, but also quite&amp;nbsp;heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Food needs to be as light and as packable as possible" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Food needs to be as light and as packable as possible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we like the food to be as simple as possible and most of the instant hiking foods contains all those preservatives and artificial stuff so we decided to create our own &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; food from basic ingredients. It’s not as hard as you might think and it’s surprisingly&amp;nbsp;cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="quick-list"&gt;Quick&amp;nbsp;list&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;One
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;breakfast: big breakfast in a&amp;nbsp;hostel&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack: peanut butter muesli&amp;nbsp;bar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;lunch: crackers with&amp;nbsp;cheese&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack:&amp;nbsp;nuts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dinner: couscous with minced beef and&amp;nbsp;vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;Two
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;breakfast: scrambled eggs with leftover&amp;nbsp;couscous&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack:&amp;nbsp;dates&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;lunch: crackers with&amp;nbsp;cheese&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack:&amp;nbsp;nuts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dinner: minced beef with mashed potatoes and&amp;nbsp;vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;three
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;breakfast: scrambled eggs with leftover mashed&amp;nbsp;potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack: peanut butter muesli&amp;nbsp;bar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;lunch: crackers with&amp;nbsp;cheese&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;snack:&amp;nbsp;nuts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dinner: big dinner in a&amp;nbsp;restaurant&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table is the approximate amount of food for two people for a three day hike that kept us full and&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class="table"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style="text-align: left"&gt;Meal&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style="text-align: center"&gt;Total weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style="text-align: right"&gt;Portion weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style="text-align: right"&gt;Price (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NZD&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Scrambled eggs&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;160 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;40 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Crackers&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;450 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;75g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 15&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Cheese&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;250 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;63g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Minced beef&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;160 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;40 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Olive oil&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;50 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;13 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Powdered milk&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;50 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;25 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Mashed potatoes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;150 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;75 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Vegetable mix&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;160 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;40 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Couscous&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;150g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;75 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Chicken stock&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;50 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;25 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Dates&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;200 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Nuts&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;200 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Muesli bars&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;300 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;50 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;$ 1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Salt + spices&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;10 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: left"&gt;Loose leaf tea&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;10 g&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;na&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id="breakfast"&gt;Breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Having breakfast in nature is an amazing feeling" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Having breakfast in nature is an amazing feeling&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, we normally have eggs in any form, but it’s not very practical to take them on the trail so we tried variations of porridge and oats — without much success as we felt hungry soon. Breakfast was an issue for us until we discovered these &lt;a href="http://backcountrycuisine.co.nz/bcc/index.php/archives/223"&gt;freeze dried scrambled eggs&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, they are made out of normal ingredients and they taste nice. We like to mix them with a bit of leftovers from dinners — usually plain couscous or mashed&amp;nbsp;potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="lunch"&gt;Lunch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love &lt;a href="http://shop.countdown.co.nz/Shop/ProductDetails?stockcode=289839"&gt;walnut oat crackers by 180 degrees&lt;/a&gt; with an aged cheddar – amazing taste and lasts forever. It’s a nice easy meal that can be spread over multiple stops and you don’t have to set up your gas&amp;nbsp;burner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Munging through those cheese and crackers" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Munging through those cheese and crackers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we carry an extra stick of Hungarian-style salami, but mostly we are fine with the vegetarian&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="snacks"&gt;Snacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We carry three different types of snack but really it’s up to you and what you like. First, we have a mix of natural nuts – usually cashews, almonds, Brazil nuts, Macadamian and&amp;nbsp;walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of commercially produced muesli bars that are full of sugar and god knows what, we &lt;a href="http://www.wildbackpacker.com/backpacking-food/recipes/backpacking-lunch-snack-recipes/"&gt;make our own&lt;/a&gt;. And it is surprisingly tasty and easy to make – you don’t even have to bake. Mix three cups of quick oats with a cup of heated peanut butter and add up to a cup of honey. Stir everything together (you can add cranberries, raisins, chopped almonds or anything you like), press it into a box container and put into the&amp;nbsp;fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="After a big hike you need to keep your energy levels high" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;After a big hike you need to keep your energy levels high&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third to the party is a pack of dried dates. Dates are delicious, more nutritious than candy and helps with your sweet&amp;nbsp;tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a small piece of dark chocolate is always a welcoming surprise after a tough&amp;nbsp;climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dinner"&gt;Dinner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner is usually your biggest meal of the day on a hike as you have time to prepare it and you don’t have to move afterwards. For a track this long, you don’t have to be too creative and meals can be quite simple. I’m a fan of freeze dried ingredients as their are light, but not a fan of instant meals as they usually contains lots of things that are bad for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fine dining in a hut" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Fine dining in a hut&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorites are &lt;a href="http://backcountrycuisine.co.nz/bcc/index.php/archives/226"&gt;freeze dried minced beef&lt;/a&gt; as a good source of protein and &lt;a href="http://backcountrycuisine.co.nz/bcc/index.php/archives/242"&gt;vegetable mix&lt;/a&gt; (carrots, peas, corn). We usually get a pack of 160 g of beef which lasts us for the whole trip and the same applies to&amp;nbsp;vegetable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two things create a base that can be combined with couscous for one day and instant mashed potato flakes for the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: Use dehydrated milk for your mashed potatoes to make it taste like&amp;nbsp;heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sandwich plastic bags are handy to store portions and save on weight" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sandwich plastic bags are handy to store portions and save on weight&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, carry a small plastic bottle of olive oil and add couple spoons to each meal to boost the calories and fat content. Remember, fat keeps you warm at&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing I love is a pot of chicken stock after the main course. I’d like to think that it adds all those important ions and salts that I lost during the hike. Maybe, maybe not – at least it keeps me&amp;nbsp;hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Your meal will always taste delicious on the trail" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hiking-food-for-a-3-day-track/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Your meal will always taste delicious on the trail&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food for two people for three day hike comes to 60 New Zealand dollars, tastes pretty good and is much healthier than the instant hiker meals that you can buy in the outdoor shops. Give it a try and let us know how you enjoyed it. Also, what do you usually eat on the&amp;nbsp;track?&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2016-03-15T06:58:37Z</published>

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/03/15/a-day-with-hobbits/">
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/71.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/71.jpg" alt="A day with Hobbits" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Christmas, during our travel around North Island, we made a stop near small town of Matamata. There is not much around, mostly farmlands, and it probably used to be one of those little quiet towns until it became the middle of Middle-Earth. The Shire with its setting known as the &lt;a href="http://www.hobbitontours.com/"&gt;Hobbiton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/81.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of surrounding farmland" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/81.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of surrounding farmland&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we visited an incredibly touristy place where you pay heaps of money for permission to walk and stare around. But we thought, when we are here, in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NZ&lt;/span&gt;, we should give it a&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/79.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="On bus with other with other tourists eager for hobbits" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/79.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;On bus with other with other tourists eager for hobbits&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we bought the tickets, our tour began with about 20 minutes drive on board of bus that took us through farmland to the Shire. In the meanwhile, our guide gave as short introduction about filming beginnings and about dealing with &lt;a href="http://media.newzealand.com/en/story-ideas/hobbiton-from-family-farm-to-film-fame/"&gt;farmland owner family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A little veggie garden - all eatable&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a car park we set off along the path to Hobbiton accompanied by our guide. Shortly, we stopped at little veggie garden where different kind of vegetable and herbs were grown. Further, as we slowly walked to up to the hill, we were passing Hobbit holes with their colourful round doorways and perfect tiny gardens. One would expect that when you open the door there would be a hobbit inside eating one of their six meals per day. Nope. Unfortunately, it was nothing inside except a few planks and&amp;nbsp;dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/69.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Beg End - the Bilbo’s place" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/69.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Beg End - the Bilbo’s place&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, we reached a hole with a deep green coloured door - the Beg End. The Bilbo’s home located under shade of great oak tree. The story of this tree was quite interesting as it was brought into Hobbiton in chopped pieces and bolted together again. Our guide told us, that when they wired all artificial leaves, the director didn’t like the shade of green colour. So, all of them had to be removed and recoloured.&amp;nbsp;Crazy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/72.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="No post today" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/72.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;No post today&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we walked down towards the lake, the smoke raised from tiny chimneys and spread above the hill. We passed a watermill with a small jetty where a hobbit’s boat was parked, crossed over the bridge and reached the Green Dragon&amp;nbsp;Inn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/73.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A watermill and a tiny hobbit’s boat" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/73.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A watermill and a tiny hobbit’s boat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked the interior of that place as the most of it was built from timber and stone. It warm and cosy with the running fireplace and leather arm chairs. As we went on the late afternoon tour, the place wasn’t too much busy which was good. Otherwise, you have to try to ignore the crowds to enjoy the atmosphere and a &lt;a href="http://www.hobbitontours.com/TheGreenDragon"&gt;pint of craft beer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/a-day-with-hobbits/76.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A chill out in front of fireplace with a pint of beer" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/a-day-with-hobbits/76.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A chill out in front of fireplace with a pint of beer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in my opinion, it wasn’t a bad experience. In Jakub’s opinion, it was a waste of money. I’m glad that we went there, but the true is that, unless you are really a fan of everything around The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies, it’s probably not worth the money – and there are &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2016/02/01/tongariro-alpine-crossing/"&gt;other places&lt;/a&gt; that are much more&amp;nbsp;spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Majestic waterfalls that also go by name Waimanu Falls and they are accessible by a cruise boat at Milford Sound. Our skipper took us really close to the watterfall so we got a bit of spray of freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/13.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/13.jpg" alt="Milford and Doubtful Sound" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During our Christmas break, we spent two days in the area of &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/"&gt;Fiordland National Park&lt;/a&gt; where we planned to make two cruises - a shorter one in Milford Sound and a full day one in Doubtful&amp;nbsp;Sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Milford Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Milford Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our base in &lt;a href="http://www.yha.co.nz/hostels/south-island-hostels/yha-te-anau/"&gt;Te Anau&lt;/a&gt;, we headed off to Milford Sound along State Highway 94 which is regarded as one of the highest and most scenic highways in New Zealand. There is a number of short sidewalks which are definitely worth stopping such as The Mirror Lakes or The Chasm but just drive itself through the glacial Eglinton Valley is&amp;nbsp;spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view across Eglinton Valley" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view across Eglinton Valley&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we reached the Homer Tunnel, the traffic started to be quite dense as the tunnel was only one way and operated by a traffic light. About 1200m long tunnel hewed from solid granite had nothing to do with those wide, smooth tunnels in the Alps in&amp;nbsp;Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waiting for our cruise at departure terminal" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Waiting for our cruise at departure terminal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Milford Sound shortly after midday and as the traffic around the tunnel indicated, the place was really busy and crowded. Boats of different operators were taking turns at the harbour and any minute we could hear a noise of small scenic planes in the air. I was at the place about 10 years ago and I don’t remember such a&amp;nbsp;buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heading off to the Tasman Sea" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Heading off to the Tasman Sea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While waiting for our cruise, we made an easy 20 minute loop through beech forest and along shore with some nice views of the fjord and surrounding peaks. But then we were ready to hop on &lt;a href="http://www.mitrepeak.com"&gt;our boat&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy the&amp;nbsp;cruise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The amazing weather highlighted the beauty of the sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The amazing weather highlighted the beauty of the sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip lasted about two hours and from harbour we cruised about 16 km to the open Tasman Sea. Straight at the beginning, we passed a massive Bowen Falls and the iconic Mitre Peak. We spotted a few fur seal colonies lying on the rocks. Once we reached St. Anne’s lighthouse and got to open sea, the waves were quite rough and our boat swung a lot. Luckily, our skipper didn’t let us suffer too long and after few minutes turned the boat back to the harbour. We concluded the cruise with the spray from Stirling Falls as the bout tried to approach it as close as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="We got a bit of spray from Stirling Falls" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;We got a bit of spray from Stirling Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had not even absorbed the Milford Sound experience yet and we were already heading off to Lake Manapouri, where we started our &lt;a href="http://www.goorange.co.nz/doubtful-sound/the-cruise/"&gt;full day cruise to Doubtful Sound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="On the way to Doubtful Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;On the way to Doubtful Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started with an early and quiet cruise across Lake Manapouri to the West Arm Visitor Centre where we got some interesting information about the adjacent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manapouri_Power_Station"&gt;Underground Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. From there, we carried on by coach over Wilmot Pass into Doubtful Sound. In the morning, we were a bit in a rush but in the afternoon, on the way back, our driver made a few stops along this section, so we had enough time to wander around and enjoy all&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The silence and calm were amazing" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The silence and calm were amazing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the day started at Dove Cove where we got on board and cruised again about 30 km to the open Tasman Sea. We slowly sailed between tiny islands which reminded turtles lying on the water surface and big peaks which reminded an elephant’s&amp;nbsp;head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/12.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="An elephant - do you see it too?" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An elephant - do you see it too?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got closer to the mouth of sound we chanced on fur seals. Later, on the way back, we met a few others that were excluded from their colonies to bulk themselves. Unfortunately, we didn’t have any luck to see penguins or&amp;nbsp;dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="It was a bit windy sometimes, but we had a lot of fun" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/milford-and-doubtful-sound/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;It was a bit windy sometimes, but we had a lot of fun&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely a good decision to go with the first early cruise option because there were  no other boats and everything around looked quiet and calm, so we could fully enjoy that isolation. It was such a big contrast to busy Milford Sound and, eventually, it was also the reason why we preferred Doubtful Sound in the final&amp;nbsp;rating.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/9.jpg" alt="Queen Charlotte Track" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I’d heard about &lt;a href="http://www.qctrack.co.nz/on-the-track-/walk-the-track/"&gt;this track&lt;/a&gt; was when a friend of mine sent me an article from National Geographic about a selection of world’s best hikes. After a short discussion, we booked a ferry, bought &lt;a href="http://www.qctrack.co.nz/track-info/qctlc-pass/"&gt;passes for access&lt;/a&gt; to private land and then just hoped for a good&amp;nbsp;weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="On board on the way to Ship Cove" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;On board on the way to Ship Cove&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, we boarded a ferry and headed off to South Island. The sea was much calmer than the last time when we were on the way back to Wellington from our Christmas holiday and when a half of passengers on board was&amp;nbsp;sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the night in one of &lt;a href="http://www.yha.co.nz/hostels/south-island-hostels/yha-picton/"&gt;Picton’s backpackers&lt;/a&gt; and the next morning we and our big backpacks were ready to set off. The sun was shining and the cruise on the boat which took us to the beginning of the track was a great start of the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of farmland at Kenepuru Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of farmland at Kenepuru Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our hike at Ship Cove and planned to stay in campsites located on the ridge, so we took all our stuff with us. A tent, sleeping bags, food and camping gear for three days – our bags probably weighed about 12&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Infinite blueness" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Infinite blueness&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were planning the track, I assumed that as it runs along the coast and the highest peak is about 400 m asl., the hike wouldn’t be difficult. The distances supposed to be long but elevation should be fine. I was wrong. The first day, we climbed about 1400 m in total as the path ran up and down all the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A path through enchanted forest" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A path through enchanted forest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to Furneaux Lodge, where we were going to catch a water taxi across Endeavour Inlet to Punga Cove, we walked through the cooling native forest and passed a few amazing lookouts with views of small&amp;nbsp;bays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The first lookout reached" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first lookout reached&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section between Punga Cove and a campsite at Bay of Many Coves was a bit struggle. I had sore feet because of too thick socks, was stung by a wasp and, in general, it was quite a long day. Therefore, we hesitated a little whether to do or not to do a side track to Eatwell’s Lookout. So lucky that we did it because the 360-degree view from the lookout was absolutely&amp;nbsp;stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A signpost at Eatwell’s lookout" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A signpost at Eatwell’s lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, the track followed the ridge line with views over both Queen Charlotte Sound and Kenepuru Sound. At selected locations along the track, there are nice new benches made from massive wood where you can enjoy a view. During our breaks, most of the time, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka"&gt;fearless wekas&lt;/a&gt; kept us&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A weka looking for something to eat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was just shortly after midday when we reached Torea Saddle, we decided to carry on and spent the night at &lt;a href="http://www.mistletoebay.co.nz/"&gt;Mistletoe Bay campsite&lt;/a&gt; which would save us some time the next day when we would rush to catch a water taxi back to Picton. We regretted this decision a little bit as we scrambled up to the highest point on the track which, however, made it up to us with more great&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A short refreshment before descend to Torea Saddle" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A short refreshment before descend to Torea Saddle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we descended from the summit, we met a man who was working on track maintenance. It was an interesting character that was really keen on holding a philosophical conversation about where the world is aiming to. After a half an hour we left enriched with a few latin expressions (which were a bit wrong as Jakub realised&amp;nbsp;later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Kenepuru Sound" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Towards Kenepuru Sound&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final descent to the Mistletoe Bay Campsite was quite exhausting as we followed a steep shortcut which ran along not a well-maintained path and at one point we were afraid that we would have to turn back and climb it all the way back. Luckily, after a while, we reached the sealed road and, eventually, the campsite as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/queen-charlotte-track/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Another tiny bay" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/queen-charlotte-track/11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Another tiny bay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were only 4 hours of walking left for the last day. After the initial climb from Mistletoe Bay, the track ran quite easily along the same contour line before it descended back to the coastline. In spite of that, it seemed to us like ages before we finally got to&amp;nbsp;Anakiwa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a big Christmas break which we spent around South Island, we kept with exploring places that are a bit closer to our base in&amp;nbsp;Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We planned to stay over the night at our favorite spot at Castlepoint and on the way there to make a walk to &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wairarapa/places/honeycomb-rock-area/things-to-do/honeycomb-rock-walkway/"&gt;Honeycomb Rock on the Wairarapa coast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A hiding cow on the way to Honeycomb Rock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach the beginning of the walk we had to drive a decent distance along a gravel road which is always a bit painful for our old car. Basically, the whole track goes through a privately-owned land, so we were constantly surrounded by sheep or cows. Most of the time, there was no clear path and we just followed wooden poles stuck among&amp;nbsp;cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lazy seals relaxing on the beach" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lazy seals relaxing on the beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about two hours, we reached an outcrop risen above rocky coast. The walls really resembled cells which gave the rock it’s name. On adjacent rocks, there was a small number of relaxing fur seals. They didn’t care about anything and just sniffled bit louder when Jakub got too&amp;nbsp;close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Honeycomb Rock named because of the cell-like pattern " src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Honeycomb Rock named because of the cell-like pattern &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive across to Castlepoint took a couple of hours and when we got there it’d already got dark. Our plans to stay over the night at the carpark were thwarted by a sign which allowed staying only to self-contained cars. It was a bit surprising as the sign hadn’t been there last time when we’d made &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/trips/2015/02/28/castlepoint-surf-trip/"&gt;our surf trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The beautiful Wairarapa coastline &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we found another spot and the next day in the morning we woke up to a wonderful sunny day and had a great view of see right from the boot of our&amp;nbsp;car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such a gorgeous weather, we decided to visit &lt;a href="http://www.patunafarm.co.nz/patuna-chasm/"&gt;Patuna Farm&lt;/a&gt; and do a Patuna Chasm walk which my workmate had recommended. So, after morning surf session for Jakub and coffee for me, we headed off to&amp;nbsp;Ruakokoputuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Part of the track ran across farmland" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Part of the track ran across farmland&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the farm we were given a safety induction and a paper with a detailed description of the walk. The beginning of the walk was marked with a weed spray arrow on one of the tree trunks along the road. It wasn’t clearly visible, so first, we passed it by, of&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="At the beginning the cold water wasn’t bad during such a hot day" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;At the beginning the cold water wasn’t bad during such a hot day&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the walk ran across farmland and through bush. We crossed the river once and enjoyed some nice views of surrounded hills. However, the real fun began when we climbed a ladder and entered to the chasm. From that point, the walk carried on through the&amp;nbsp;river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A waterfall at the upper end of chasm" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A waterfall at the upper end of chasm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few meters upstream was a nice waterfall, but then we followed the way of flow and walked downstream through the narrow limestone gorge. Most of the time, the water level reached only up to our knees. But, there were some parts which got a bit deeper and we ended with a backpack above our&amp;nbsp;heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The rock tunnels" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The rock tunnels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking for the best way to get over one deeper spot, we ran across a number of fossils as we climbed over a big&amp;nbsp;rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we proceeded to the end of the chasm, we walked through a few massive tunnels where stalactites hung from the ceiling and along the&amp;nbsp;walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="At some parts it got quite dark and cold as well" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/hidden-secret-of-ruakokoputuna-river/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;At some parts it got quite dark and cold as well&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we went through the end of the chasm, the sun and warm air were really nice as, despite the middle of summer, the water was quite cold. However, all that fun was definitely worth our frozen toes and we got warm on the way up back to our car&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/10.jpg" alt="Tongariro Alpine Crossing" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tongariro Alpine Crossing is one of New Zealand’s most popular walks as it is easily accessible, it takes only about 5 to 7 hours and during nice weather conditions you can enjoy amazing views of volcanoes and small colourful&amp;nbsp;lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A colourful volcanic landscape" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A colourful volcanic landscape&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we did the crossing last year, the weather wasn’t ideal because, while we were driving to the beginning of the track, it looked like there are no volcanoes at all. Luckily, when we reached the Red Crated and slowly descended to Emerald Lakes, the sun brought through the clouds and from the further side of Central Crater we could see the Red Crater, previously covered by&amp;nbsp;clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Blue Lake in the background" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Blue Lake in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, Jakub was luckier about the weather and all highlights showed up in the summer&amp;nbsp;sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One disadvantage of the track is its popularity itself. During the high season, there are heaps of tourists who climb up to the Red Crater as a long slow snake. Now and then, we were surprised what kind of clothes were people able to wear for such kind of track, when they were supposed to walk in&amp;nbsp;debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inside the Red Crater" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Inside the Red Crater&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, as we organised an early shuttle, we avoided the crowd and walked through the Mangatepopo Valley up to the Soda Springs only with few other people. From that point, the people started to accumulate as the terrain got steeper and up to the Red Crater they already moved on as a giant&amp;nbsp;snake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/3.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Soda Springs on the way to the Red Crater" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Soda Springs on the way to the Red Crater&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest point of crossing, the Red Crater, we had to pass without any good view as it was covered by clouds. We couldn’t see it, but we definitely could smell&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, while we were sliding on debris down from Red Crater, the sun came out and the brilliant Emerald Lakes showed up. The giant snake stopped and the mass photography&amp;nbsp;began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Emerald Lakes" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Emerald Lakes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crowd spread again as we walked across the Central Crater and once we passed the Blue Lake, the Red Crater appeared at the back so, at least, we could see it from the bottom when not from the&amp;nbsp;top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Red Crater out of clouds" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Red Crater out of clouds&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the track was a bit boring. Particularly because of dense clouds which covered everything all around and disabled any good views, but this part of the track was also long and same all the time. We did a quick stop at Ketetahi Hut, but then carried on with a fast pace to finish the&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The clouds covered everything around" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tongariro-alpine-crossing/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The clouds covered everything around&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, almost at the same time as we finished the track, the sky cleared up. Now? At least, while the shuttle was driving us back to our accommodation, we had a great view of all the volcanoes. Moreover, as a bonus, we could see a small volcanic activity at a side vent of the volcano. A little compensation for bad&amp;nbsp;weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The walk across the Central Plateau&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; The photos with the sunny weather were taken by Jakub this year when he did the&amp;nbsp;crossing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/11.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/11.jpg" alt="Tree Trunk Gorge and a Naughty Possum" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a big plan for our last free weekend before Christmas. After a few evenings, spent by looking for a right track, we finally decided to drive up north to Lake Taupo and do a multi-day track in the Kaimanawa&amp;nbsp;Forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/1.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of a few crossings during Tree Trunk Track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of a few crossings during Tree Trunk Track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sunny afternoon, our journey easily went by and we also managed to avoid to the usual Friday’s traffic jam when everybody tries to escape from Wellington. After a short dinner break, which we ate with a company of calm sheep, we arrived at our camping spot when it was already&amp;nbsp;dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/4.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The forest in sunshine" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The forest in sunshine&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day morning brought a disappointment. The hills were covered in dense clouds and showered by the persistent rain, there was no point to climb up to the hills with no chance of any good views. Time to change our&amp;nbsp;plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/5.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A camping spot" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A camping spot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first replacement - Pillars of Hercules track - was not a big success. After a few meters, the path of the track got overgrown and as we were struggling through vegetation we got totally wet. Eventually, we lost the path completely. The highlight of this track was a view from swing&amp;nbsp;bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/2.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A swing bridge along Pillars of Hercules track" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A swing bridge along Pillars of Hercules track&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the Tree Trunk Gorge track was a much better choice. It was a nice easy walk through the native bush with a few crossings over the streams and it ended with an amazing view of pure water rushing through a narrow&amp;nbsp;gorge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/7.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The view of Tree Trunk Gorge" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The view of Tree Trunk Gorge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking for a place where we’d stay over the night, we found a little lake Rotopounamu At the beginning of the loop around the lake, we met a Polish guy, who had been travelling in New Zealand for a couple of months and we made the loop&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/9.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The look around lake Rotopounamu" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The look around lake Rotopounamu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place for overnight stay we found near the Okupata Cave - in the middle of nowhere. The road there was in terrible conditions. The rain had created deep gullies across the unsealed road and our poor old car could hardly cope with it. No signal and more constant rain made up ideal conditions for Jakub’s tragical scenarios of being stuck there and never get back&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/8.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="A view of Lake Taupo" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of Lake Taupo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation escalated when suddenly, in the middle of the night, a funny noise started to coming out from the car engine. A naughty possum biting our car cables! The possum would have really laughed seeing Jakub with a torch, running around the car in the middle of the night, during heavy rain and trying to frighten it off by knocking and banging on the bonnet of our&amp;nbsp;car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/6.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Tree Trunk Gorge again" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Tree Trunk Gorge again&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the possum probably found something better to eat then our cables because the next day morning we easily started up and drove away right after we’d had a quick look at near cave&amp;nbsp;entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://barakuba.com/photos/960x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/10.jpg" class="gallery-link"&gt;&lt;img alt="Next to the entrance to Okupata Cave" src="https://barakuba.com/photos/640x/tree-trunk-gorge-and-a-naughty-possum/10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Next to the entrance to Okupata Cave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, all that panic was for nothing. However, the next time we’ll try to find a place closer to civilisation. Or at least, closer to cell phone signal. Just in&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
